The [Object Materials Patch](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Object_materials) has grown in popularity since first appearing in NetHack brass. Some ideas here may already be implemented in some of the variants that have added them.

### Properties of weapons
* Iron - good against fairy, elf, and fae creatures
* Gold - associated with the sun, so good against undead. Blunt gold weapons get a d2 damage bonus due to being heavier.
* Platinum? Copper? Metal? Wood?

### Effects of gear
* Mithril body armor prevents bisection.

### Elves and iron
* Elves take extra damage when hit by iron. Not as much as silver, but still appreciable.
* Elven players take a small amount of damage when putting on or wielding iron gear, but get no further penalty. (dnethack hurts their regeneration rate while wearing iron, which is another option).
* Possibly some detrimental effect when wielding iron weapons as well, a to-hit or damage penalty, or negating bonuses from dexterity, strength, and skill, or something.
* This is balanced by elven racial equipment being better (not improved; it's already better).

### Metalworking
Would be a pretty neat addition as a service that offers things the player can't do on their own (probably not a shopkeeper service though), and some things they could do on their own but lack the resources. In particular, silvering has a lot of potential if the Object Materials Patch is used. Also see [Crafting](/bigideas/crafting.html).
