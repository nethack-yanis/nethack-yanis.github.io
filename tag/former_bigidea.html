  Earlier incarnations of the YANI Archive had "Big Ideas" - conglomerations of
  ideas from many people around a single theme. However, with the ability to tag
  ideas and search by tags, that has become increasingly obsolete, and
  additionally the Big Ideas were becoming like black holes for their respective
  topics, where new ideas might just get tacked on and make it hard to identify
  who came up with what. This tag denotes ideas that came from the breakup of
  those Big Ideas and are still quite large.

<p>
  Not <i>all</i> former Big Ideas are tagged with this: small enough
  self-contained chunks that could survive on their own are treated like
  standard YANIs.
