<p>"Smite targeting" is a shorthand to mean some effect that can be targeted at
any space within a certain radius and usually in line of sight from its
originator, but not necessarily in a direct line with them, like a scroll of
stinking cloud or the advanced fireball spell. Such effects are often something
that comes down on the target space from above like the smite of a god, rather
than flying there in a line.</p>
