<p>This is the idea that if there are two sources of a similar effect, and one
is a consumable, non-infinitely-renewable source (scroll, potion, wand, etc)
and the other is a renewable source (usually spells), the effect provided by
the consumable source should be superior. Otherwise, the consumable source
becomes useless to a player with the renewable source at their disposal.</p>
