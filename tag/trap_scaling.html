<p>
  Traps don't scale very much (floor traps' having minimum dungeon levels for
  random generation is about all there is), and this hurts their balance. Since
  a trap will have the same flat effect in all situations, it tends to become
  unthreatening to a player sooner or later, and then having it appear in the
  rest of the game is pointless. Conversely, some trap effects are too deadly to
  early characters. In Gehennom, the traps have probably literally been designed
  by demons, yet the only difference between Gehennom and the rest of the
  dungeon is the existence of fire traps.

  These ideas are about making traps' threat level increase as the game
  progresses.
