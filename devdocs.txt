Regarding the filter pages system (show all ideas with a given tag/author)

Filter pages can filter on either tag or author, and will list ALL ideas
for that respective tag or author.

HTML files in the tags/ folder should have this exact front matter:
layout: filterpage
tag: [its tag, spaces OK]

Their filename should be the same as the tag but should use underscores in
place of any spaces. This has no programmatic relation to the tag defined in
the file, but it does determine the URL.

HTML files in the authors/ folder work on identical principles.

Jekyll cannot generate these files on its own; they must be provided separately.
