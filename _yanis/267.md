Yellow lights should have a light radius of larger than 1.

Also add white lights, white-colored <span class="nhsym clr-white">y</span>
monsters which have a light radius of 3 or 4, with a blinding gaze attack and no
explosion attack (unless keeping the explosion attack is too thematic to the y
class, in which case it should blind for a long time).
