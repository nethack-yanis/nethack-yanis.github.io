Iron doors, which generate 30% of the time a normal door would be generated on dungeon levels 7 or below. They use the symbol <span class="nhsym clr-cyan">+</span>. They work the same as normal doors, but they cannot be burned, kicked, or blasted down, or destroyed any other way. If one happens to be locked, you have to unlock it "properly".
