The potion of restore ability can be used to recover lost maximum Pw.
It only restores _maximum_ Pw, not current: if your Pw is 30/80 and you
previously had 100 maximum Pw, these potions will only be able to get you to
30/100.
* If cursed: does nothing (as usual)
* If uncursed: you recover one quarter the difference between your current
  maximum and your peak maximum, or 5 points, whichever is greater.
* If blessed: you recover half the difference between your current maximum and
  your peak maximum, or 10 points, whichever is greater.
