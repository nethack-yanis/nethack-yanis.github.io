New artifact *The Phial of Galadriel*. It is a potion of water (potion of
starlight in dNetHack) that acts as an infinite light source which scares giant
spiders and Nazgul that come into it, and can be invoked to bless 1 item. May
need more powers to make it better, and behavior for what happens when you drink
it, but these are unspecified.
