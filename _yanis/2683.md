Implement multiplayer as a system where each of the players is in a completely independent dungeon, generated with the same seed so that all levels and branches are created identical. There is a swapchest-like system for exchanging items between the games, without any limits on what can or can't be swapped, other than unique items and that items can only be swapped within the same co-op game, not all existing games.
