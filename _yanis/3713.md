Blessed tinning kits have a chance of creating multiple tins from large,
high-nutrition monsters. Specifically:
* If the monster's corpse is 800 or less nutrition (the amount from a food
  ration), it always makes 1 tin.
* If the monster's corpse is greater than 800 nutrition, it produces NUTR / 800
  tins, plus possibly one more with a (NUTR % 800) / 800 chance. (So a monster
  whose corpse is 2000 nutrition would always produce 2 tins with a 50% chance
  of a third.)
* It expends a charge for each tin produced like normal. If it would make more
  tins than there were charges, the amount of tins is capped at the number of
  charges.
