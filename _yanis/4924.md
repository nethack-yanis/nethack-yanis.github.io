If you find a bones file with a ghost and corpse and successfully resurrect the
dead player by drawing the ghost back into its body, the game should save its
current state with the NPC and hero swapped so the player character is now the
one who had died, change the "owner" of the save to the previous player, and
make the save file available for the previous player to continue on in. The save
is not made available to the finder of the bones, who can keep playing their
game as normal.
