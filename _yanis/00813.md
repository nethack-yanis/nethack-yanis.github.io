"Painting" dungeon feature / furniture. Players can look at them to see what it's a painting of, possibly identifying item types they didn't already know about. Could be free-standing (<span class="nhsym clr-magenta">\\</span>) or could be part of the level flags of a wall (<span class="nhsym clr-magenta">\
</span>, interactable by farlooking them while adjacent). Might be able to be haunted - can produce a ghost?
