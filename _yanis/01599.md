When either you or a creature is brought below 10% HP while wearing an amulet of life saving, it "begins to glimmer". Note that something should be done to prevent this message from appearing in rapid succession if the wearer heals back up around 10%. Also, ideally, something should be done to prevent the player identifying the amulet of life saving by hurting themselves deliberately until under 10% HP.
