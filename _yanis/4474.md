Every time Sunsword hits a monster, it should cause temporary blindness to the
tune of several turns.

Alternatively, since that type of blindness may be tricky to implement, have it
induce regular monster blindness upon a "critical hit", with the same frequency
as other artifacts like Vorpal Blade.
