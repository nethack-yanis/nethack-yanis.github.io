Establish two subclasses or sub-roles of Monk: weaponless (traditional) monk and
weapon-using monk.
- The choice can be either configured with a game option or chosen in initial
  character setup.
- Using weapons when you have chosen to be weaponless, or vice versa, you take
  alignment penalties.
- Weapons monks could start with shuriken and have much poorer maximum energy
  growth per level.
