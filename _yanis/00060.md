Buff late-game undead, because undead's significance in Gehennom tends to be pointless since they aren't scary by the time the adventurer gets there.
* Zombies can resurrect in Gehennom akin to GruntHack zombies.
* Spectres, which are like wraiths but much faster and with more attacks.
* Vampire mages.
* Skeletal dragons.
* Minotaur zombies.
* Z might need to be made ungenocideable.
* GruntHack-like zombies, which inflict zombification sickness and eat your brain to drain Int.
* Shades can generate in graveyards in Gehennom.
