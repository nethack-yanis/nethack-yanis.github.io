Spell of sunray, a level 7 attack or evocation spell that effectively focuses
the power of the sun on its target (despite being in a dungeon), dealing either
very powerful fire damage or simply instantly disintegrating the target. (A
compromise could be powerful fire damage in most cases, with the target
disintegrated if it reduces their HP to 0, but with undead always being
disintegrated).

It could shoot a ray, but might be better off if it used smite targeting like a
blessed scroll of fire to strike a single square you don't have to be lined up
with, effectively trading the ability to hit multiple targets for increased
lethality.
