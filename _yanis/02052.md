Illusion / disguise self spell: Makes a monster appear as a different monster type of its choice. Perhaps if you have extrinsic see invisible (and only extrinsic), you can see through such illusions. Would be more effective in monster hands than player hands (perhaps in player hands they can disguise themselves so that monsters who didn't see them cast the disguise have a chance of being fooled and not attacking).
