5% of killing hits with Fire Brand, on a monster that can leave a corpse, never
do leave a corpse. This is accompanied by the message "The [monster] freezes
solid and shatters!" or "The [monster] burns to ash!"

Note that this idea is NOT for the Brands to instakill monsters 5% of the
time. It just blocks a corpse drop 5% of the time.
