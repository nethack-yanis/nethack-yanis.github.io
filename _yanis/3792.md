A system where your god grants you cool abilities, but only if you actively obey
randomly generated edicts they put forth. Examples:
* "I declare the wearing of leather forbidden!" (persistent)
* "I declare Abipoppo the Shopkeeper must die!" (one-time)

If your god orders you to do something that would make you suffer alignment,
anger, murder, or Luck penalties, you are not punished for that.

Conceieved as a new race, or an extension of the angelic race, but could also
apply to Priests or Infidels.
