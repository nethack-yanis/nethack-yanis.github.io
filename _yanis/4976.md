Using too many adjectives on a wish (e.g. "fixed", "blessed", "greased") should
have a risk that only some of them, selected randomly, will be respected. This
is intended to encourage choosing only the most important adjectives rather than
wishing for everything that could possibly matter.

Not specified whether adjectives that are part of an item appearance (i.e. the
"red" in "red potion") should count.
