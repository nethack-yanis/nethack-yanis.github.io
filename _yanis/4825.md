Remove the blessed scroll of genocide's whole-class genocide ability. Make it
instead do what the uncursed scroll currently does, where you name a species and
it gets genocided. The uncursed scroll of genocide is now the one that prompts
for a monster class, but instead of genociding the entire class, it genocides
one random, genocidable species from that class.
