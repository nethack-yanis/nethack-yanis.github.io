Add paraelemental planes to the ascension run, placed before or after their corresponding elemental plane:
* the Plane of Ice corresponding to Air or Water,
* the Plane of Ooze/Mud corresponding to Water or Earth,
* the Plane of Smoke corresponding to Air or Fire,
* the Plane of Magma corresponding to Fire or Earth

Either a random one of these planes would be inserted along with the four regular planes, or they would all be inserted but there would be mini-quests or objectives in the Mazes of Menace that when completed would prevent those planes from generating or skip over them.
