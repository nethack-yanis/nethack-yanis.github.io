Corridor generation should sometimes prioritize connecting a room to an existing
corridor which connects two other rooms, instead of always having to terminate
at a room and ignoring corridors that already exist. This would reduce or
eliminate "wide corridors" in dungeon levels formed by two nearly parallel
corridors generating on top of each other, and promote more interesting level
shapes where corridors have neat 3 or 4-way intersections.
