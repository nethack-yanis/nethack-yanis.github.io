Leprechauns should sometimes wake up when someone is moving near them carrying a
large sum of gold. Their awareness doesn't extend to the precise location of the
creature, it's just enough to shake them awake.

The chance of this happening and/or the distance at which this happens should be
dependent on the amount of gold carried.
