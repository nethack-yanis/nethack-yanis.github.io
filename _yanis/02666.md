You cannot levelport down past a demon lord's lair level until the demon lord is killed, appeased with a bribe, or otherwise gotten rid of. Attempts to levelport past it will just land you on their lair level instead. However, you can still go below the level by way of the stairs, a hole, or a trapdoor in the lair.
