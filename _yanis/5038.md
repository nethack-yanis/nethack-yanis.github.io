New "Kobold Caves" branch based on Tucker's Kobolds. The branch is populated
with ordinary weak kobolds, but the main challenge is in their deviousness, not
their fighting strength. It contains lots of nasty traps such as cockatrice
corpses atop pits. The kobolds themselves frequently carry nasty items such as
potions of paralysis and cockatrice eggs.
