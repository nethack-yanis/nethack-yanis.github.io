Make the Longbow of Diana able to change shape between the different types of
launchers (bow, crossbow, sling), either by invoking it or simply by applying
it. This allows Rangers to play with whatever type of ranged combat style they
prefer, and allows gnomish Rangers to use a crossbow without being coerced into
switching to bow later.
