Container traps' effects scale based on dungeon level (ideally on the level a
container generated, not on the current level, so a player can't bring a chest
up to level 1 to make it use the weakest possible trap.)

In addition to adding some more effects, also add some effects which
cosmetically are the same as other ones, but are more or less damaging. This
would, however, make untrapping containers even more useless than it is now;
perhaps a trap should stay armed even after you set it off. Another idea is to
give certain traps an arming item, like a potion of oil for the fire effect and
a land mine for the explosion effect. Successfully untrapping it will deposit
the arming item into the container.

Also, make container traps independent of Luck, because currently they encourage
the player to ignore containers until Luck is maximized.
