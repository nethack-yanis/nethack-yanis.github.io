When you hit a tree with fire from any source, it can turn into a burning tree (<span class="nhsym clr-red">#</span>). This burns for a few hundred turns before burning out and turning into normal floor. While on fire it acts as a light source of radius 9, and deals fire damage to anything adjacent each turn and occasionally to anything within a radius of 3. Come to think of it, there could also be a "bonfire" terrain using the same glyph.
