A "slotlocks" option, taking a string which specifies the inventory letter slots
you really do not want newly-acquired items to go into, such as the ones you
usually reserve for key pieces of gear.

As an example, if you have `OPTIONS=slotlocks:aGHsdy`, no inventory items will
be placed on any of those letters until they are the only remaining open slots.
Once that happens, the first open slot in the string, "a", will be filled,
unless you already put something in that slot, in which case "G" will be
attempted, and so on.

Adjusting items to different slots is not affected by slotlocks since it's
presumed you are deliberately putting an item in that slot.
