The debug fuzzer, when it levelports, should pick a random level from the entire
dungeon rather than using random levelportation logic, since this tends to lead
to it bouncing around the upper levels of the Dungeons of Doom rather than
actually going anywhere significant and into new branches.

Or to make this a bit more configurable, there should be an additional iflag
added that controls this levelporting behavior which can be enabled in a
debugger similar to how iflags.debug_fuzzer is.
