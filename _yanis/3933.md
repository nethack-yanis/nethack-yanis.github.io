Monsters with AT_EXPL kamikaze attacks are excluded from the regular
is-this-foe-too-strong-for-me level checks. The point of those checks is to
prevent a monster from attacking something too strong and getting hurt in
retaliation, and if the attacker's modus operandi is to blow itself up at the
enemy, that isn't relevant.
