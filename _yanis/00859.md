Float stone, a gray stone which has negative weight. Non-stacking, and rare. If you get enough float stones to more than cancel out your own weight and the weight of any possessions you're carrying, you levitate. Possibly doesn't work when put into containers. May gain positive weight when cursed, or greater negative weight when blessed.
