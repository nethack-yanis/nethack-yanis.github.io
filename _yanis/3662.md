Randomize the set of "critical" extrinsics and the base items that provide them
in each game. I.e. instead of every game having a cloak of magic resistance,
ring of free action, and amulet of reflection, the game could have a ring of
reflection, a cloak of free action and an amulet of magic resistance.
