Instead of a mslow flag in the monst struct, use a signed char called "speedbon" which represents the amount of speed offset that the monster should have from its normal speed. This allows for more nuanced speed mechanics, like zapping a wand of speed monster or slow monster multiple times and having the effects stack.
