Rogues gain a backstab-related bonus when they and their target are in darkness.
Possibly, just make many/most attacks in darkness deal backstab damage when
they ordinarily wouldn't.

A more complex implementation would be to differentiate monsters that aren't
susceptible to darkness because they spawned in a naturally dark area from
monsters that are.
