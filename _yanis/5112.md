Buff Cavemen by giving them "natural magic" or "primordial magic" - while
keeping their existing low Intelligence, they could have the best growth rate of
maximum Pw and the best base spellcasting success rate among roles. They could
also possibly start the game with knowledge of some spells, or have a mechanism
of learning certain early-game spells without needing to find a book for them.
