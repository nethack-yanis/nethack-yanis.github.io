A trap that, when it's triggered, makes the wall or ceiling crush together over
a few turns to squish the target. Ceiling might be more ideal since it wouldn't involve
terrain moving around.
* It would presumably only generate in well-defined room areas.
* The trap would cause instadeath to any creature caught in the crush, except
  unsolid ones, leaving no corpses.
