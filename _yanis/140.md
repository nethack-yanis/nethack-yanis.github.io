You should be able to loot trees to get less fruit than you might by kicking it,
but with a much lower chance of getting bees. Looting the tree might fail, in
which case you might fall out of the tree and abuse Dexterity or something
similar. If you are polymorphed into a Y, it has a 100% chance of success; if a
human or elf, probably 80%; if an orc, 40-50%; if a gnome or a dwarf, 1-5%.
