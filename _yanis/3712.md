New monster "vapor cloud", similar to the fog cloud, except it is made up of
potion vapors and instead of doing damage, it causes the uncursed vapor effect
of potions to happen to you when engulfed. (There probably has to be something
preventing a vapor cloud of paralysis from paralyzing you eternally.)

When it moves over a potion, it consumes the (topmost if there are multiple)
potion and changes. With 50% probability, it either switches to the potion
consumed, or rolls for alchemy as if combining its existing potion cloud with
the new potion (probably rerolling events like turning to water, evaporating,
and blowing up in an alchemic blast, though it would be funny if it blew itself
up).

Hostile vapor clouds will intentionally seek out harmful potions to consume and
will avoid beneficial potions.
