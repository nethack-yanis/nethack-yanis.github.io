Cartomancers don't spellcast using Pw. Instead, they read the book (which is
instantaneous for them, and possibly subject to a failure chance like normal if
the spell is not known) and the spell immediately takes effect. This increments
the read counter for the book, so each book can be used to cast a spell 4 times
before it blanks.
