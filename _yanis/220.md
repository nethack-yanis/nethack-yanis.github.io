Player monsters, crossaligned priests, and hostile angels on the Astral Plane
should be able to steal the Amulet from you. If they get it, they will try to
make a beeline to their high altar to sacrifice it.

The player is also able to steal the Amulet back, though, and wearing the Amulet
acts as one turn of protection against it being stolen: an attempt to steal it
will just remove it from your neck.

If something else ascends, your game ends in an escape. However, the crowd of
Astral monsters are hostile towards the Amulet-bearer, not you; so if it gets
stolen from you, the pressure will let up a bit.
