Cooking system in which you apply a knife to corpses to turn them into raw
ingredients, then combine them over a hot surface such as a campfire or lava to
turn them into food items that are superior to raw corpses, whether that's by
having increased nutrition, conferring temporary slow digestion, boosted
intrinsic odds, raising attributes, or other benefits. One specific recipe
mentioned is combining a cockatrice's heart and potion of acid to produce a food
that cures stoning and gives temporary stoning resistance.

The lack of cooking gear in the game (other than dented pots) means there might
have to be some sort of fixed "cookpot" dungeon feature found at various places
which acts like the ones in Zelda: Breath of the Wild; a specific place to
combine food items together.

If the cooking system uses fixed recipes, there should be cookbooks
containing various recipes so they don't require spoilers to find out.

One major flaw pointed out with a cooking system is that it has to somehow
establish itself as better than merely eating corpses, so it either has to
deliver amazing benefits from eating the food or nerf corpse-eating, while still
allowing it to be practical to play vegan or foodless. One possibility is to
remove most roles' ability to eat raw corpses (Barbarians and Cavemen could
retain this ability as a role benefit).
