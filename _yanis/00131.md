Remove instances of "bad RNG" contributing to forms of instadeath or a disproportionate bad effect for a RNG decision made mostly or completely independently of the player's decisions, because they just add randomness or variance to the outcome of the game:
* Poison instadeath
* GWTWOD
* Chameleons turning into out-of-difficulty monsters the player can't handle
