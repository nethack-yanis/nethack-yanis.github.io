Saltwater, intended as a nerf for "just dilute most potions":
* Potions of saltwater behave exactly like potions of water, except that they cannot be used to bless or curse things. Holy (and unholy) water must be pure.
* All in-game sources of water except for magic fountains are saltwater. Diluting potions in them will yield only potions of saltwater.
* Can also get pure water if a unicorn horn dip would already result in water.
* Not specified what cancelling potions should do.

Alternatively, make saltwater not an actual potion, and just use saltwater as a flavor reason for why the player can't intentionally dilute potions to water. (Can use a separate flavor argument, that potions are generally corked while not used, to explain away the lack of dilution for water damage.) Also, make most potions cancel into non-water base potions (such as confusion and hallucination to booze), with the notable exception of polymorph. It's also harder or impossible to get water from random alchemy or polymorph.
