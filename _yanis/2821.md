When removing a helm of opposite alignment, after restoring your original alignment, increment your god's anger. Do it after removing the helm because then your original god gets angry at you for putting the helm on, not your new god.

If god anger is tracked separately for each god, it doesn't need to be done this way; merely make your original god angry when you first put on the helm.
