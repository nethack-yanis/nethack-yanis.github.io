Asmodeus and Baalzebub have a chance of re-appearing hostile to their levels (not a certainty; if they always came back there'd be no reason not to kill them off) when the player is on the way back up with the Amulet. Flavor-wise, this is because the player only paid for safe passage ''down'', and now the player has their coveted Amulet.
