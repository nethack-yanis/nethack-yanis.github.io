Boots that act like the Hover Boots in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
They do not actually make you levitate like boots of levitation will, but will
instead delay falling for a turn or two, so you can cross holes, pits, and
1 or 2-square wide liquids like water. If you stay still on the space without
support and let the timer run out, you will fall. In order to mislead the player
into thinking they might be water walking boots, they may give no special
message when activating.

Not specified if this should be an ordinary random piece of magical armor, or a
minor artifact.
