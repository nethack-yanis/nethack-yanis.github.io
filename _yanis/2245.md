Remove the odd feeling messages from magic traps. Instead move them to a new trap, a "foresight trap", which gives you a vision of something to come. Once triggered, the trap vanishes. Effects can be:
* "You hear a far-off song: .A.EF" - give part or all of the passtune
* "You have a vision of [something]" - reveal something about the dungeon structure, like "stronghold far below"
* "A shiver runs down your spine!" - create a level-appropriate "scary" monster somewhere on the level, like a ghost or other undead
* "You smell charred flesh." - create a level-appropriate monster with a fire attack somewhere on the level
* "You hear distant howling." - create a level-appropriate werefoo on a level above or below
