Remove the recharge counter from objects. Most tools can be infinitely
recharged, so they don't need one. For wands, replace the recharge count with a
chance of a wand becoming eroded when the wand is recharged, or of exploding if
recharged when already eroded.

Not specified what happens for the few items that don't follow this pattern,
such as magic markers and the wand of wishing. For the wand, it will likely work
to make the erosion guaranteed the first time, and the explosion guaranteed when
it's already eroded. Magic markers could possibly just be un-rechargeable.
