Mimics should try to impersonate containers more frequently than they do. There
are a few proposals for accomplishing this in the Dungeons of Doom:
- Have a special case that generates a mimic in each room with very low
  probability per room; if a mimic does generate it will always imitate a chest
  or large box.
- When a large box or chest is generated in a room during level creation, there
  is a small chance it instead becomes a mimic imitating that type of container,
  replacing the box. However, the chest contents must be carefully discarded to
  unmake any artifacts that happened to generate inside it.

Both of these only happen on levels where the mimic being generated is within
its ordinary level difficulty range.
