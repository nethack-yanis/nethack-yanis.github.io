Lycanthropy fixes:
* It triggers much more rarely, every couple thousand turns, but while you are in your beast form you lose all control.
* Or it triggers much more predictably, with messages making it clear that a change is coming, and the duration of the change is both more limited and more predictable.
* Or it triggers on a certain damage threshold or after taking a particularly strong hit, determined by your level, HP max, and phase of the moon.
