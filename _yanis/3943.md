In variants with percentage-based intrinsics, see invisible is no longer a
binary attribute. Eating invisible stalkers now gives you various percentages
of the intrinsic. While extrinsic see invisible still works like it does now,
allowing you to see any invisible monster in line of sight, intrinsic see
invisible shows you invisible monsters in line of sight within a certain radius
from you. The radius increases with the percentage, possibly the square root of
the percentage (so 64% see invisible is a radius of 8, and 100% is a radius of
10 - note that 100% still is less powerful than extrinsic see invisible's
unlimited range).
