The #attributes screen gives you several time-related pieces of info:
* The current time as observed by the game. (Possibly it should just tell you whether it's night or midnight).
* How long it has been since you started the game in wallclock time, for speedrun checking.
* How long your current session has been.
* The current phase of the moon.
