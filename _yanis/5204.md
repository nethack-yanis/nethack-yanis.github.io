Rework roles entirely. You start out as a generic adventurer with no special
skills, and as you gain levels you choose a path - allowing the progression of
your character to follow a branch in a tree structure rather than a single line
of progression determined by your role.

The Quest could be tricky to handle in this system, because it has to generate
the home level when you first arrive in the branch. After gaining a few levels,
your path would be set enough to generate a particular role-like quest, but it's
possible to reach the Quest branch without gaining any levels. One possibility
could be if you reach the Quest before choosing enough of your path to
specialize, you get a unique "pacifist quest".
