A #shove command, which allows you to shove a monster back one space, and will
not anger most peacefuls, for the purpose of pushing peaceful monsters out of an
altar room when they start crowding the altar you are trying to sacrifice things
on. (Presumably, shoving a shopkeeper or priest or anything trying to stick to a
specific location would not work the same.)
