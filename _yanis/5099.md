If you do not talk to your quest leader by a certain turn count, a peaceful
same-role player monster NPC named Chad, Stacey, Kevin, or Jennifer should
appear on the quest start level, with the implication that they already did the
quest.
* The NPC is equipped with ascension-level gear which includes your role's quest
  artifact and a wand of death missing at least one charge.
* When you chat to the NPC, their lines consist of humble-brags and passive
  aggressive insults about your gear.
* The quest leader's lines are replaced with glowing praise for the exploits of
  the NPC.
* They do not have the Bell of Opening; the nemesis still has it. The
  implication is that the interloper made a backroom deal with the nemesis to
  make your own game harder.
* The quest leader will allow you to enter the quest to get the Bell, since they
  are aware it is needed for getting the Amulet of Yendor, but the levels of the
  quest will not generate any floor objects, while still having all or most of
  their monsters - the implication being the NPC looted everything already.
* There should be a TDTTOE case for when the hero is already named Chad or Stacey.
