Solve the problem of pets wasting their hard-trained apport by picking up and
dropping objects randomly all over the dungeon, by triggering them only to use
it when the hero plays any instrument (or maybe any non-magical instrument).
Bonus points if the player can train the pet by playing an arbitrary sequence
of notes (chosen by the player) on tonal instruments.
