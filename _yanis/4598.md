Gold and shadow dragons should have a passive blinding attack, because they
currently have none and are safe to attack in melee. Gold dragons' passive could
be flavored as a flash of light which hurts drow and gremlins, but this might be
annoying for anyone with a pet gold dragon and getting blinded all the time as
it fights monsters.
