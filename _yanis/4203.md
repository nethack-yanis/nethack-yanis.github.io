In order to add variability between different games, at the start of every game,
"theme" objects and monsters are selected, which are outsizedly likely to
generate. For instance, one potion type becomes the "theme potion" of the game,
and then 10% of all randomly generated potions are that potion, and a wand type
becomes the "theme wand" and 10% of random wands will be that wand.

Three theme monsters are picked, one low level, one medium level, and one high
level. The probability for them generating when a random monster generates
should probably be lower than 10%.
