Luggage pet for Tourists. Has very high carry capacity and doesn't drop items of its own accord. Fights like a normal pet. Either it is immune to damage but has a low maximum level to compensate, or if overwhelmed, it doesn't die but instead turns into a normal "luggage" object that will eventually reanimate.
