Jar of honey. This would be either a food item or a potion, and can be applied
to smear it on yourself or on your armor like grease. You can also remove it
like grease, unless the jar was cursed.

While you are honeyed, monsters generate more frequently, and bees and bears are
especially likely to generate. It might also automatically steal noncursed
weapons you are hit with in melee, flavored as them getting stuck in the honey.
