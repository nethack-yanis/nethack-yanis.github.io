Redesign the Wizard's Tower so the hero enters in the southeast corner on the bottom floor, spirals into the center with the upstair, the second floor has the downstair in the center and spirals out to the upstair in the northwest. The top floor has its downstair in the northwest and basically the same layout as now.
