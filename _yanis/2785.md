Giants can rip doors off their hinges, by picking them up, to use them as weapons. They do a lot of damage, and can only actually be wielded by giants. Possibly, kicking a door with excessive strength (and/or being a giant) not only breaks it off the hinges, but sends it flying to hit anything unlucky enough to be in its path.

There isn't really an obvious object class for a 'door' object to be in, though WEAPON_CLASS is probably the most straightforward.

Possibly also allow this with sinks or trees. All of these heavy improvised weapons should probably use club skill.
