Occasionally when fighting in melee with a weapon you are Expert in, not
twoweaponing, and there is no special artifact effect already in play, you get
some special benefit of that weapon type. Ideas:
* Some of the longer swords allow parrying monsters' attacks.
* Mace or flail or morning star could stun or confuse targets
* Stiletto gives you automatic counterattacks sometimes.
* Spears can skewer through an enemy and hit another one directly behind it.
