Rarely, and only once per game, name a randomly generated large box "Pandora's Box" upon creation. Such a box contains a ton of good loot, but opening it (or destroying it, or tipping it) alters several overarching gameplay mechanics that all make the game tougher.

This should probably be defined as an artifact whose base type is a large box, since that cleanly takes care of the rare, random generation problem. However, since it's not as straight up beneficial of an artifact as most others, perhaps it shouldn't count as a generated artifact for gifting/wishing purposes.
