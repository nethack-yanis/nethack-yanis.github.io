A shopkeeper who hates you (e.g. for having stolen from them) will be reluctant
to serve you and will insist you wear a shirt and shoes before you enter.

In variants with racial shopkeepers, the shopkeeper can also hate you on
principle without you doing anything wrong. In variants with Convicts, their
striped shirt could be unacceptable for purposes of having a shirt.
