On the level below the Quest portal, there is another magic portal to part or a
whole of another role's Quest. Possibly this leaves off the home and goal
levels, consisting of only the filler and locate levels, or only the locate
level as a single-level branch, or else it removes the nemesis and artifact,
removes the restriction on going past the home level, and gives the quest leader
some insulting lines to offer to this competitor for the Amulet.
