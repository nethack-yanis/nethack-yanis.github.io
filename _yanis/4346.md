A new single-level "heaven" branch, reachable by levelporting to a negative
level, that is filled with angels guarding the "Holy Scepter", a new artifact
with unspecified properties. There is an exit portal on the level, and the
angelic guards are peaceful unless angered or the Scepter is taken. If you
steal the Scepter, you can sacrifice it on Moloch's high altar to get a bad
ending to the game.
