Wands should require being wielded before they can be zapped; this way it adds
a bit more strategy for the player on when to wield a wand and which one, and
balances them a bit relative to monsters. On the other end of the change, you
now get a turn or two of warning when a monster is about to zap a wand, because
they have to wield it.
