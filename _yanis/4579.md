Special armor that some role starts with, either magical or very good
stats-wise, but once you remove it either suffers serious damage and requires
requires resource-expensive repair to put back on, or simply disintegrates. The
flavor would probably be something like spiritual armor gifted to you by your
god. The armor would have to be not so good that one would *never* want to take
it off; decent mundane early-game armor would be a general improvement over it,
perhaps suggesting that the special armor should be magical in a very
situationally useful way.

Inspired by a bug in which a giant character could start wearing body armor,
which was too small for them and which, being a giant, they could never put back
on once taken off.
