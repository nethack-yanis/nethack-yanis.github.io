If you're polyselfed to a lithivore, worthless glass tastes terrible but valuable gems taste delicious. Each gray stone gives a different YAFM: "Yabba-dabba delicious" for flint, "That was a heavy meal" for loadstone, "The stone's texture is delightful/distasteful" for touchstone, ??? for luckstone.
