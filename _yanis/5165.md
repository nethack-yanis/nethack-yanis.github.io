Cavemen should be able to make cave paintings on the ground with blood (possibly
their own blood, dealing damage to them, if they have a sharp object with which
to draw blood). The available paintings are selectable from a menu, and each
type grants a unique buff to Cavemen who stand on it, sort of like wards in
dNetHack except not necessarily focused on warding off monsters. You learn more
powerful paintings as you level up.
