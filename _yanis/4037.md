Something to prevent autounlock from automatically forcing a chest you want to
open. This probably takes the form of a new option, either an "autoforce"
boolean option or a new paranoid confirmation flag which would add a prompt (or
turn the existing prompt into a "yes" confirmation) before you force a chest
with autounlock.
