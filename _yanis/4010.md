Occasionally, if a Mines filler level generates where there is a sufficiently
large space of empty stone, a little separate walled-off area may generate
disconnected from the main map, containing a few gnomes and dwarves, and some
more gems and gold, possibly in a chest. This area won't get the stairs
generated in it, and should probably contain a hole so that a randomly
teleporting player won't get stuck there (other types of escape items could get
picked up by the gnomes and dwarves).
