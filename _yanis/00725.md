Failing to make a jump because the player selected a point outside the jumping range ("Too far!") should not cost a turn, and the interface should make the jumping range clear, perhaps by highlighting all the squares you can jump to. Or else if you try to jump to some square outside the jumping range, you'll jump as far as possible in that direction within the jumping range.
