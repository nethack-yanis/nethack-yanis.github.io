Replace the current Basic-to-Expert skill system with a skill tree. Each role is
given affinities for skills in this tree, which represent how easy it is to for
them to enhance that skill. The baseline value for an affinity is 100. The lower
an affinity number, the better it is for that role, because enhancing a skill
costs (some base cost * affinity / 100) skill points. Skill points are awarded
on each level up.

The end result is a system without arbitrary skill caps, where anyone can
theoretically become expert in whatever they want, but if it's something
they're unsuited for they'll have rendered themselves unable to become skilled
in much else.
