Monsters have different degrees of intelligence, which changes their strategy
for doing certain actions like fleeing (do they flee intelligently like monkeys
do, or in a random direction?) and using items (a dumb monster might try to read
a scroll of fire and burn itself to death). At any rate, more intelligent than
the current definition of "having hands and neither mindless nor animal".
