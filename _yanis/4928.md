There is a problem when examining the circumstances of someone's death in a
dumplog: when the player does something that prompts for a direction, the action
they are trying to do does not appear in any messages except those that result
from the action, so if it doesn't produce any useful messages, this remains
unclear.

To resolve this, the getdir prompt should take an optional prefix string,
changing from "In what direction?" to "[Cast/zap/apply X] in what direction?"

One potential issue with this is that if X is an object, it could contain a
user-supplied name which has a higher character limit than for prompts. The
object name could be truncated if it's really long.
