Potions of phasing should themselves phase, and therefore should only be able to
be handled by magic. Any that generate or get dropped should immediately phase
through the floor and fall to a lower level, unless the current level has an
undiggable floor. (This means they would keep falling down from level to level
until finally arriving at one with an undiggable floor).
