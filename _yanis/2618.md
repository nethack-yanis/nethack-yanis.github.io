Implement a player fear system that unlike many other proposals, does not take away agency from the player by paralyzing them or forcing them to flee using a predefined algorithm. Instead, it *incentivizes* the player to flee by making continued combat unattractive.

Create a new intrinsic called "Panic"/"Panicking". Sources of fear (including existing sources of paralysis-fear, e.g. ghosts) give you temporary amounts of this intrinsic. While you are panicking:
* You have a large to-hit penalty, possibly making it so that you can only land a hit when rolling a natural 20. (Directly subtracting a large number from to-hit could still be overcome by wearing rings of increase accuracy and would be hard to balance the exact number.)
* You deal half damage for any attack you can make land.
* Ranged attacks have a high chance of misfiring in the wrong direction.
* Spells not in the escape school or designated as emergency spells (or healing spells, for variants that remove emergency spells).
* Your skills may be treated as if they are the levels you started the game with.
* Your speed is slightly boosted (if possible, only your movement speed, not your general attack/item use speed).
* If you die, your death reason will have a "while panicking" appended to it.
