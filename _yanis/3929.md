Assuming an implementation containing multiple puzzle branches (to offer players
an alternative to Sokoban), have all the branches start from an "antechamber"
level off the main dungeon. This is a small unpopulated level, and contains
terrain clues around each puzzle branch staircase in it, such as boulders and
strangely shaped walls for Sokoban, ice if there is an ice sliding puzzle, etc.
