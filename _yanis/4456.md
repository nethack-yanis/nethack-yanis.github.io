It is possible to get a scroll of genocide both blessed and cursed at the same
time. The effect of this is that it prompts for a single monster, genocides most
of that monster, and sends in the remaining several monsters who are now looking
for revenge.

Alternatively, make this a confused effect instead of opening the can of worms
of allowing items to be simultaneously blessed and cursed.
