Spiders have an attack that wraps you in a web (using sticky behavior?) or creates a web on your square and traps you in it, so you can't move. Possibly, create a new "web" object that is only intended to travel through the air (just like venom projectiles; it would be VENOM_CLASS and disappear at the end of its flight) that creates a web on the space it ends on, trapping any monster on that space, then have spiders shoot this object from a distance.
