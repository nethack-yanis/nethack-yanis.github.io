Dipping a spellbook in any healing potion will restore one of its read charges.
Dipping it in a potion of restore ability will restore all of its read charges.
In either case, you get a message "The book's ink becomes fresher and sharper"
(or "fresh and sharp" if all its read charges are restored) and the potion is
used up.
