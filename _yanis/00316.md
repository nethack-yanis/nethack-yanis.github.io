The scroll of remove curse's blessed effect is transferred to its uncursed effect. The blessed effect is now to uncurse everything in inventory, and then bless a few items. The cursed effect now randomly curses inventory as the curse items spell would do. May need to make this scroll rarer or more expensive to write in order to keep it balanced.
