New role whose unique game mechanic is that it can dip magical items into
corpses to change them into other magical items.
* As an example, any magical ring dipped into any nymph corpse would turn it
  into a ring of teleportation.
* The "recipes" would probably be fixed rather than randomized each game.
* The intent is to create a different play style for this role since they can
  effectively guarantee finding important items.
* To balance this out, items should randomly generate at a much lower rate for
  them.
* Alternatively, when you remove a piece of equipment that you created via this
  method, it disintegrates, or just rings and amulets if this proves too
  annoying to do with magical armor.
* It could be flavored as various things, such as "crafting" or "imbuing", but
  dipping (in the blood of the corpse) avoids having to add a new
  command.
* An important element is to make sure the differentiation lasts through the
  whole game. If this role ends up converging on building a standard ascension
  kit by midgame and then not changing it much through the rest of the game, it
  will be both poorly differentiated and it won't use its core benefit much.
