Water elementals' HP (and Pw, if applicable) regeneration is boosted when they
are on a water-containing space such as a moat or a fountain. Possibly, they can
also suck up the water to regain a large quantity of hit points at once, which
removes the water terrain if it is expendable (a fountain or pool or puddle of
shallow water will dry up).

In order to make them more interesting in combat, their AI may favor hanging
around sources of water and trying to find a path to the nearest water when they
are injured.
