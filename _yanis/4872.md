Spell staves should have active or passive effects that scale up with your skill
in the stave's spell school. For instance:
- The staff of enchantment may apply confusion or sleep to monsters you hit with
  it.
- The staff of holiness reduces the chance that your items will get cursed.
- The staff of healing gives increased HP regeneration.
- The staff of evocation increases your damage output while standing on grass,
  or grants you the phase-through-trees ability.
