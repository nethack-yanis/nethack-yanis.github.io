Water nymphs may create a pool on their spot when killed. Items they stole from
the player fall into it, of course. If in a variant that implements shallow
water or puddles, those are more reasonable to create than a deep pool.

Wood nymphs may create a tree on their spot when killed, and mountain nymphs may
leave a boulder.
