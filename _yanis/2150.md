Trees' fruit is generated along with the tree (possibly buried for code purposes so that it shows up on object detection but not when you just look at the tree, or perhaps just "embedded in the tree" is good enough). When you kick or chop down the tree, this fruit is released rather than generating some fruit on the spot.
