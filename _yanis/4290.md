New room-joining algorithm for regular Dungeons levels and levels which use
des.random_corridors:
* Pick one random room and consider this room to be "the set of connected
  rooms".
* Repeat the following until every room is in the set of connected rooms:
  * Pick 2 random rooms, one from the set of connected rooms and one from the
    set of not-yet-connected rooms, and pick a random point in each room.
  * Draw a straight line between those two points. Route the line around
    intervening rooms if necessary.
  * If the line intersects with an existing corridor, dig only the part of the
    line from that intersection up to the unconnected room. Otherwise, dig the
    whole line out.
  * Identify the points where the line crosses the outer walls of the rooms, and
    make doors. If it enters or exits at a corner, shift it to an adjacent wall
    space.
  * Add the unconnected room to the set of connected rooms.
