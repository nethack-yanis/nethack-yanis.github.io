Gentle relaxations for the quest XL requirement:
* It is waived if you have set the "descent into Gehennom" flag by going downstairs from the Valley.
* It checks maximum XL reached, not current; so if you have ever been XL14 it doesn't matter if you have been drained since.
* It is waived if you have the demigod flag set from killing the Wizard of Yendor.
