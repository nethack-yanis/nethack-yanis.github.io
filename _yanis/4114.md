In variants that have element-specific mages, the message for a sacrificed
corpse disappearing is different if you are playing as one:
* Ice Mage: "The corpse is swept away in a blast of frost!"
* Acid Mage: "The corpse dissolves into thin air!"
* Fire Mages either use a standard burst of flame, or a message suggesting more
  powerful flame.
