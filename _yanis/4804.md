Add an artifact spear of Odin that grants flying when wielded, and replaces
Mjollnir as the first sacrifice gift for Valkyries. This is intended to give
them a reason to use their starting spear and reduce the inevitability of
Excalibur, while being flavorful towards both Odin with the spear, and towards
Valkyries with their mythological power of flight.
