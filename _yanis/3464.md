When the game calls for a message to be shown based on its string id in the
quest.lua data file, it also supports running a function that tests whether the
hero is blind and/or deaf and returns different string messages accordingly.
(E.g. a lot of quest messages describe the surroundings, which doesn't make
sense if you're blind.)
