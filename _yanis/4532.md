Remove the ring of levitation. This is because it is too good at solving
interesting problems from the player: for the low cost of a ring slot used only
situationally, the player can bypass water, lava, most traps, and wield
cockatrices with almost total immunity. It can then be taken off when not wanted
and put back on whenever situationally needed again.

As an alternative to removing the ring, add some cost to using it, such as
requiring them to be invoked to get levitation, subject to a cooldown to use
them again, although that is strange and unprecedented for non-artifact items.

The boots of levitation have more or less the same problems as the ring, only
slightly less so because they are heavier and swapping out boots takes a little
longer. These could also be removed, and replaced with an artifact pair of
boots that confers levitation, themed after the *talaria* winged boots Perseus
borrowed from Hermes. (This also has some potential for strangeness, because
Perseus's statue appears in the game and sometimes contains levitation boots;
would the boots always be this artifact if it doesn't exist already?)
