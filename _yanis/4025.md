A statue-like object which should be fairly destroyable (should probably be
breakable by force bolts and maybe even attacking it with a weapon enough times)
which provides a level-wide buff to certain monsters.
* An example of such an effect is "phylum gating" - e.g. if the statue-thing is
  an ant, it will grant all ants on the level a power to gate in more ants like
  demons do.
* This is the only example given, but there are plenty of other buff
  possibilities.
* The buff could also be within a specific area rather than level-wide.
* Rather than a new object, this could simply be implemented as a special flag
  on a regular statue.
