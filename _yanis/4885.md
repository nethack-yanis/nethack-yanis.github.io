The Rat King Mines' End level should be changed so that obtaining the luckstone
doesn't rely on getting into a sealed chamber by teleportation; it's a challenge
that is either completely trivialized if you happen to have teleport control or
requires you to tediously step on a teleportation trap many times until you
happen to be teleported into the sealed chamber.
