Archeologists see value indicators on weapons and armor that are not fully
identified to get a vague idea of what they are. Examples given are "an
extraordinary [weapon]" for a +4 weapon or "an average [weapon]" for a +0
weapon. At higher experience levels they may be able to identify the exact
enchantment automatically. This is flavored as appraising the age and quality of
antiques.

A slightly different implementation may make it non-guaranteed to see this,
with the odds dependent partly on experience level but also on intelligence and
luck.

A third proposal is that it doesn't happen automatically, but they can get this
indicator or identify the enchantment of a weapon by rubbing their touchstone on
it.
