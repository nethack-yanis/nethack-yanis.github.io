Wielding Mjollnir (or potentially any artifact) after it was gifted by your god
requires the god to spend constant divine attention on powering it. In game
terms, this means that your prayer timeout will never drop below some minimum of
a few hundred turns, because the god will not take kindly to requests for more
assistance after they are already constantly giving you it.
