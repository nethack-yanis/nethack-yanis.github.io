Artifact large box *Pandora's Box*: it contains a ton of good loot, but opening it (or destroying it, or tipping it) alters several overarching gameplay mechanics that all make the game tougher.

Since it's not as straight up beneficial of an artifact as most others, perhaps it shouldn't count as a generated artifact for gifting/wishing purposes.
