Player monsters, rather than just being randomly hostile, actually try to quest for the Amulet, and they do this even when you're not on the same level. If you wait on the Dlvl1 upstairs for long enough, player monsters will enter and quest downwards, and eventually one will come back up having retrieved the Amulet. If the player monster with the Amulet leaves the dungeon or reaches their own high altar without you, you lose.
