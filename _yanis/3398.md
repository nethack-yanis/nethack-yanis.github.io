A shop type which is one of those magical shops that you only see once and isn't
there when you go back, in which you can buy only one item. One possible
implementation is that after buying an item, you are teleported out of the shop
or even levelported to a nearby level, and then the shopkeeper and the rest of
the items in the shop are removed, as well as possibly the entire room. There
may be some need to prevent normal methods of theft from the shop.
Alternatively, you could be permitted to buy multiple items, but the shop
disappears after you leave.
