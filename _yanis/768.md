Add two fields to struct trap: an object, which represents the "ammo" of the trap (darts, arrows, potions of oil), and a number to represent the "level" of the trap (which can affect a lot of things, such as a to-hit bonus the trap gets, how hard it is to untrap, or what the skill was of the player when they set the trap).
