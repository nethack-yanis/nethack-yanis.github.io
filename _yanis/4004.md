The number of turns you can remember a spell is directly dependent on your
Intelligence, and possibly Wisdom (at the time of reading the book). The default
20000 turns is a baseline for maybe 12 Int and 12 Wis; more of those means you
get more turns when you learn the spell or refresh your memory, and less of
those means you get fewer turns.
