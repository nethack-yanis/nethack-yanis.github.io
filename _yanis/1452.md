Some limited way to charge rings that isn't the general-purpose magical charging that also charges wands and tools. Maybe add a "scroll of enchant ring" that, like armor and weapon scrolls, only works on rings.

See also [L's Scroll of Enchantment patch](https://bilious.alt.org/?299), which merges ring, weapon and armor enchanting into a single scroll.
