At Skilled or above, the spell of wizard lock can be targeted at any point (that you can see) in a radius. It doesn't shoot a beam, and you don't need to be in line with the thing you want to lock.

Possibly, at Expert, it locks everything within the radius, but this is not good unless you have the ability to choose whether you want this effect to be cast or not.
