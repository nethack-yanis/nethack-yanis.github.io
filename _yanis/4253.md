Dynamite in SLASH'EM should be changed so that it uses a digging explosion, and
carves out tiles in its blast radius, rather than just a really powerful fiery
explosion that doesn't affect terrain. It should probably also create pits
randomly in the blast radius.

Also, Archeologists should start with some dynamite (though perhaps they, or at
least Lawful ones, ought to get alignment.penalties for using it, since blowing
up your dig site is poor archeological practice).
