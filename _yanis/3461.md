Collection of vague ideas around a new "chef" role:
* Immunity to choking.
* Gets bonuses of some sort for being satiated.
* Either starts with a tinning kit and tin opener and gets a bonus from making
  tins, *or* eating from tins is a disgrace to their palate and gives them
  penalties.
* Hungers faster than normal, but is able to get extra nutrition out of corpses
  if they properly prepare them.
* May have similarities to hobbit races in some variants with regards to food
  mechanics.
