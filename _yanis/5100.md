You should be able to throw food at Watch members to pacify them, since they
regularly complain that "The food's not fit for Orcs!" The odds of pacification
could increase with increased nutrition of the food (making food rations
effective), increased quality of the food (making e.g. candy bars effective and
possibly a 0% chance of pacification for corpses or any food that is "bland"),
or some combination of the two.
