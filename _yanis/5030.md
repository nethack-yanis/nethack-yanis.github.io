Add "collapsed corridor" and "cracked wall" terrain types. These act mostly like
solid rock and solid wall, except that if you attempt to move onto it you can,
if you would be capable of squeezing past a boulder. Would be more useful if a
light, stealth-based character build that ordinarily carries little enough stuff
to squeeze past boulders were viable.

Not specified which characters these would use in text-based windowports.
