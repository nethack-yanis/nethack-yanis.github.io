You can genocide the Wizard of Yendor (possibly only once, in his initial
incarnation). This will leave the Book dropped in his tower, but since this
counts as killing him, harassment begins immediately. When he returns after
being genocided, he says "So... thou thought thou couldst genocide me, fool."
