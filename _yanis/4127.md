Make the Plane of Fire more interesting by:
* Getting rid of the fire traps (which mostly serve to provide lots of message
  spam).
* Making the entire plane constantly deal damage if you aren't extrinsically
  immune to fire, more if you lack both extrinsic and intrinsic resistance.
  Being close to or over lava hurts you even more, and can deal damage even if
  you are immune or "like fire", possibly based on how many of the 9 squares
  immediately are you are lava.
* Lava can erupt randomly from lava, which does major damage for levitating over
  it.
* Ensure the portal cannot spawn right next to the arrival location.
