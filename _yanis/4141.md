If you attempt to move into a ghost's space (either if it's invisible and unseen
by you, or by m-moving, *not* by moving normally towards it when you know
something's there which would still be an attack), you successfully move there,
displace the ghost to an adjacent space, and take some damage from creepily
passing through a ghost. If this is implemented in an extra evil way, this could
be cold damage that destroys potions.
