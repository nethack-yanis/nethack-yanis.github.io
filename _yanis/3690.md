An alternative proposal rather than having a scroll of knowledge (which tells
you the randomized appearance of an item type in your game) as its own item, or
the same effect as something you can get with a confused identify scroll: have
the Oracle sell reverse-identification as a service. This would require some cap
on the amount of times to prevent you from learning every important item,
perhaps 5 or 7 plus a small random factor per game.
