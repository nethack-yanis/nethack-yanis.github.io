Cavemen should have "intrinsic cave awareness" - meaning that they "just know"
the layout of the floor they're on. This could be implemented a couple ways:
auto-mapping the rooms on the level but not the corridors when you get within a
certain distance; giving you a sort of persistent, limited clairvoyance which
maps any walls within a certain radius of you (but not any floors, corridors, or
other terrain) every turn, or being able to see walls in line of sight at any
distance - but not the floor between you and the wall, if it's dark.
