Jousting is treated as a bonus action which does not cost the player anything,
and does not strictly require making a melee attack. In order to joust, you
must be 1) riding while wielding a lance, and 2) move in the same direction twice
in a row with an enemy lined up at the end of the 2nd move. When this happens,
the enemy is attacked automatically.
