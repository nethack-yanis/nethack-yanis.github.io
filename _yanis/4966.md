In variants that have multiple sources of life saving: Avoid the problem of
the code's assumptions that if you get lifesaved multiple times it means you are
in wizard mode, by burning up all of your active life saving sources upon the
first thing that kills you, so getting lifesaved twice does still mean you're in
wizard mode.
