Add another divine smite in the form of inflicting some duration of temporary
intrinsic hunger. It's a nice counterpart to your god filling your stomach when
you pray (which is inaccessible if you get smited with hunger, since the god has
to be angry).

This may be tricky to balance because either it happens early in the game and
there is not sufficient food, making this a death sentence; or later in the game
and there is so much food that this is a minor annoyance.
