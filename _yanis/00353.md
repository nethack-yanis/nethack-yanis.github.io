Several things relating to making the upper dungeon feel more "eroded" or exposed to the elements/other adventurers, in keeping with NetHack flavor that other people have been seeking the Amulet:
* Falling rock traps on shallow levels come "pre-disarmed", which is to say that they have already been used up and so should consist of a pile of rocks on the ground underneath a falling rock trap with no rocks left in it.
* Rolling boulder traps on shallow levels generate without boulders or with out-of-line boulders.
* Traps with ammunition can have a few pieces of that ammunition lying on the appropriate space.
* Dilapidated armories.
* Monsters on these levels are likely to generate with zero-charge or low-charge wands or other items.
* Fewer items lying around.
* Randomly destroyed walls.
* Fake bones piles (see below).
