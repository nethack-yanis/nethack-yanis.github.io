Outside the Plane of Air (where there is no gravity), stepping onto air terrain automatically makes you fall to your death unless you are levitating or flying. (Or possibly you merely fall to a lower level, taking a fair amount of damage). However, you are prompted to confirm stepping out into the open air if it isn't safe to do so.

Items dropped into open air either end up randomly placed on a lower level if there's a sensible lower level to place them on, or vanish forever (though in that case an exception needs to be made for the unique items).

If falling into air is an instadeath, life saving acts the same as if you die in lava; it puts you on a safe location ("You find yourself back on solid land again").
