Cursed wind instruments (bugle, whistle, most horns) stick to your face when
used, preventing you from using #chat or making other forms of conversation (to
shopkeepers, demon lords, priests, etc, though most of these are ambiguous on
whether the hero needs to speak) and possibly also preventing eating.

Alternatively, using the cursed wind instrument could simply produce "You hurt
your vocal cords!" and make you mute for some length of time.
