Attempt to fix the broken alignment system by tracking positive and negative
alignment incurred separately. Then, make all alignment checks based on the
ratio of one to the other, rather than the difference. (So for instance if you
pray, your god will check to see if you have e.g. 50 times as many positive
points as negative, and if you don't, they will not answer your prayer.)
