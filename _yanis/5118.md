Add a crafting system, but only Cavemen can use it since in real life no one was
manufacturing gear and they had to make things themselves. Examples of this
include:
* Whittling a quarterstaff or club with a knife creates other wooden weapons,
  like boomerangs.
* Combining a quarterstaff or spear with an obsidian stone to make a
  high-damaging obsidian-tipped spear.
