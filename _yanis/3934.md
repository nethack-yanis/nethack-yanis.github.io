Beverage tins, which contain a potion instead of meat from a monster. Randomly
generated ones always have potions with the "bubbly", "fizzy" or "effervescent"
appearance.

When you eat such a tin, it "opens with a loud hiss!", making noise in some
radius. It always takes 1 turn to open regardless of beatitude. Then you are
shown its appearance. If you are not blind, you see it directly ("It contains a
bubbly liquid"); if you are blind but have identified the potion, you recognize
the potion by the smell; otherwise you get a generic "It feels like some liquid
is inside". Then you're prompted to drink it, like with any other tin. If you
do, you experience the same effects as you would from a potion of the
corresponding beatitude.

Tinning kits could possibly convert potions into homemade beverage tins, but
there needs to be some sort of downside which hasn't yet been proposed. As it
stands, you would be able to convert a 20-weight potion into a 10-weight
unbreakable potion. The existing downsides are that it expends a tinning kit
charge and the resulting potion can't be dipped, alchemized with, or thrown, but
for the sort of potions one would want to turn into tins, these aren't really
downsides.
