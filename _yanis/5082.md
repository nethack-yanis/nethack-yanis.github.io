Don't have an open 2x2 space in the Gnome King's Wine Cellar where all the gems
and luckstone are stored. Leave the gems where they are, but embedded in solid
rock. Possibly, there should be an engraving or two on the ground saying
something like "we have almost reached the mother lode", to compensate for the
lack of an obvious reason to mine into that area when magic mapping will not
show anything. Also, guarantee a pick-axe on the level, possibly only if no
dwarf generated there with a digging tool.

This is intended to replace the current solution of guaranteeing a teleport
scroll in the 2x2 space, which is intended to prevent the hero getting stuck
there with no way out, but isn't a perfect guarantee. (A monster could spawn
there before the hero arrives, pick up the scroll, and use it after the hero
arrives, or the hero's teleport could be incredibly unlucky and randomly pick
one of the spaces in the 2x2 area as its destination).
