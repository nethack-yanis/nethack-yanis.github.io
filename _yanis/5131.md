Revamp the sacrifice and artifact-obtaining rules as follows:
- Your first two artifact wishes will always succeed (except in standard cases
  such as the artifact existing already or being your own quest artifact).
- Your god will only ever gift 3 artifacts. The first will still always be your
  role's first sacrifice gift if your role has one and it doesn't already exist.
- In variants where gods grant non-artifact gifts, they will only ever gift 10
  non-artifacts.
- When you would be given another gift but you have already hit these limits,
  you get a final gift: a scroll of mail with a message from your god saying
  something that amounts to "please stop sacrificing".
