Change Vorpal Blade to do very high damage (on the order of x3 or x4) when it critical hits, in order to remove YAAD potential in monster hands. Replace the decapitation message with "Your Vorpal Blade goes snicker-snack!" Find some other message to replace this existing message (when you are neutral crowned but already holding Vorpal Blade).
