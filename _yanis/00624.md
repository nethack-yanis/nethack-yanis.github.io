Change Vorpal Blade to do very high damage (on the order of x3 or x4) when it critical hits, instead of decapitation, in order to remove YAAD potential in monster hands. The new critical hit message is "Your Vorpal Blade goes snicker-snack!" (Some other message might be needed to replace the existing message when you are neutral crowned but already holding Vorpal Blade).
