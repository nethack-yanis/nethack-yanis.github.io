Weapons have a very small chance per hit of breaking, to make it a memorable
event when it happens.
* Blessed, positive enchantment, or an artifact: never breaks.
* Uncursed and +0: 1/32000 or 1/32768 chance of breaking.
* Cursed or negative enchantment: 1/1000 chance of breaking.
* Chance is multiplied by 20 if the weapon is thrown and did not hit a monster.
