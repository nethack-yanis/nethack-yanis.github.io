Artifact _The Poisoner's Chalice_, a chalice that can be dipped into types of
potions that form poisonous coatings on weapons. When this happens, it gains
charges and additionally gains the ability to coat weapons in that type of
poison indefinitely. When a weapon is dipped into the chalice, it expends a
charge and coats the weapon in the current type of poison. Invoking it switches
the poison type to any of the ones it already has.
