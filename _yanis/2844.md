Squirt gun: a weapon which can be loaded with a potion (using up the potion), giving it ammo for 5-10 shots. When you fire it, a liquid projectile flies through the air, and causes potion effects (identical to those of throwing a whole potion) to whatever monster it hits.

It would be silly to define a separate liquid projectile object for each type of potion; probably the best implementation would be to have a single "splash of potion" object and use some field on the object, like corpsenm, to track what sort of potion it is.

Loading water into the squirt gun can be used to discipline pets.
