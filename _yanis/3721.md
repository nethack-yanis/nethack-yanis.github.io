"The Amulet of Vitality", an amulet of drain resistance that provides poison
resistance and hungerless regeneration when worn and also increases your HP
maximum by 20%.

Note: this could be implemented in a game that doesn't have the amulet of drain
resistance by instead making its base item the amulet versus poison and giving
it drain resistance when worn.
