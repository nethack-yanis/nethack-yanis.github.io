Eating a mimic corpse typically makes you mimic some object besides a pile of
gold, giving you an opportunity to identify it if you don't already know it. You
get the message "You can't resist the temptation to mimic a [object]" with that
object's randomized description being appended if it was previously unknown.

The odds of getting an object you haven't discovered are controlled by your Luck.
* If Luck is 0, you mimic the first random object type the game picks.
* If Luck is positive, the game rerolls up to Luck times to try and find an
  unidentified object type.
* If Luck is negative, the game rerolls up to Luck times to try and find an
  *identified* object type.
