Aligned priests can use turn undead against undead monsters they want to attack.
"Want to attack" is not currently well-defined for priests vs undead in NetHack,
but it would probably follow these rules:
* High priests don't turn undead, for simplicity.
* Priests of Moloch turn the player if they are polymorphed into an undead, but
  don't turn other undead monsters.
* Other priests turn undead that are near them, whether that is the player or
  not. This opens up an interesting strategy where you can flee from undead into
  a temple and the priest will help you out.
