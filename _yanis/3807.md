Make lycanthropic transformations non-instantaneous: you start to get messages
5-10 (or however many) turns before the transformation happens. For instance,
"Your body itches all over." This serves as a reminder if the player forgot or
didn't notice they had lycanthropy, and provides an opportunity for the player
to remove armor to avoid it breaking.
