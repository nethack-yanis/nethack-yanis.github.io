The Heart of Ahriman should do instakill when it is slung and hits a monster
with a head who is not wearing a hard helmet. To encourage this, Barbarians
should get Basic skill in sling.

To compensate for inevitable cheap deaths, any monsters that are too important
to cheaply instakill via this method need to be given hard helms of some sort.
