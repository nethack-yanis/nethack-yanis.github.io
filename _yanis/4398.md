Artifact-like system for monsters that applies a new set of stats on top of an
existing monster's stat block. The monster is not G_UNIQUE, but only one of it
can spawn in a game.

A simpler solution would be just to add unique monsters to the monster list and
figure out a way to allow these monsters to spawn randomly.
