Using #monster when polymorphed into a demon allows you to call for hell-p from
other demons directly, without needing to hit an enemy in melee. This uses up
some Pw. It may not work 100% of the time, but will cost Pw regardless of
whether or not it works. Another possible restriction is that you need to be
next to a known enemy for it to work.
