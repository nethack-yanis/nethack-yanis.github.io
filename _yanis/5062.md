Remove bag of holding explosions when a wand of cancellation is put into them.
(Keep the explosion mechanic if a second bag of holding is put inside.) In
exchange, make it so that whenever the hero is carrying a charged wand of
cancellation, either in open inventory or in a container, it interferes with any
bags of holding and prevents them from reducing the weight of items.
