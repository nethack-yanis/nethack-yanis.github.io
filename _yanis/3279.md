A new game ending where you can take an fake Amulet of Yendor into the Planes.
This is only achievable by having your fake Amulet be unidentified, and have
some combination of high Luck, being crowned, and high alignment record. The
idea is that your god is so blinded by your excellence that they allow you into
the Planes without checking that the Amulet is real.

In the Planes under this scenario, the Wizard's harassment stops (if indeed he
was harassing you at all; you don't need to kill him or do the invocation to get
into the Planes under these conditions).

When you get to Astral and offer the fake Amulet, you trigger a different ending
in which your mistake is realized and you are condemned to become one of the
player monsters roaming around on Astral until the hero with the real Amulet
shows up.
