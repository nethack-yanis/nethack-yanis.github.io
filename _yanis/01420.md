Dungeon branches that are completely submerged: their levels have a special level flag that treats you as underwater no matter what the terrain is. Would work better if a breath timer were implemented rather than instant drowning if a magical breathing source is lost. Trying to go down the stairs leading into the branch without the ability to survive underwater is equivalent to jumping into a pool: you will get wet and then crawl out (still on the stairs), without changing levels.
