Tins dropped by / generated with hobbits are biased towards high-nutrition
preparation methods. Additionally, there can be some high-nutrition preparation
methods which only appear on hobbit tins: "wild mushroom foo", "second breakfast
of foo", "foo for elevenses", "luncheon foo", "foo tart", "foo porridge", "foo
stew". If hobbit is a playable race, they are capable of making these tins with
a tinning kit in addition to the regular "homemade". And possibly an artifact
tinning kit that allows anyone to produce hobbit-style tins.
