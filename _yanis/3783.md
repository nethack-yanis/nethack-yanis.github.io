_Amulet of Storms_, an artifact amulet of flying that additionally grants shock
resistance when worn, and allows you to pacify true v monsters (i.e. not
alternative forms of other monsters that happen to be turned into a vortex as a
defined alternative form, such as vampires and the Wizard of Yendor, but
counting shapechangers such as chameleons) when chatting to them.
