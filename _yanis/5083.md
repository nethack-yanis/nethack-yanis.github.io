A shop type, or occasional lower-level shop, that is guarded by a drawbridge
over a 1-square moat rather than by a regular door.
* While you are inside the shop and carrying unpaid items, the shopkeeper shuts
  the drawbridge, and reopens it once you are no longer carrying it.
* If used to squash monsters, it should have a chance of breaking every time it
  squashes a monster so it can't be used infinitely; however, if the shopkeeper
  is operating it and not you, you don't get any experience points for the kill,
  but you do if you used magic to close it.
* If you do cause the drawbridge to be broken (on your turn rather than on the
  monsters' turn), the shopkeeper charges you for the cost of repairs even if
  they were the one operating it.
