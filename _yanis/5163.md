If you die as a Druid while polymorphed via wildshape (probably not polymorphed
via other means), you should simply die outright, rather than reverting to your
ordinary form. This is based on the idea that the regular polymorph "second
health bar" in NetHack is a guard against randomly turning into a weak monster
and having no other option than to die, but that doesn't apply to Druids who
chose to turn into something.

To compensate for this, Druids should be allowed to use wildshape without any
limit or cooldown.
