Statue traps should not depend on there being a statue on the same space as the
trap. Instead, a statue trap should internally store a coordinate as its "launch
point", ideally a point within line of sight, and when the trap is triggered it
will animate a statue at that coordinate, if one still exists. (Statue traps
will still generate a statue upon creation, just at the launch point).
