Any randomly generated large box in the dungeon may become named "Pandora's
Box". It works like Schroedinger's Box in that it's a normal non-artifact box
which is never trapped, and the special behavior when it's opened is to spawn a
bunch of nasty monsters around the player and subtract 2 Luck (and interrupt
the normal box-opening process). However, there is something good for the
player inside.
