A formula to provide diminishing returns on the HP growth you get from potions,
which is currently unbounded.

In the formula, X represents the total amount of extra HP points you would have
in vanilla (1 per blessed healing, 5 per blessed extra healing, etc), R
represents the *actual* amount of extra HP points you will have under this
formula, e is Euler's number (a constant), and A represents the desired
asymptotic upper bound of extra HP points you will approach:

R = (2A / (1 + e^(-2x/A))) - A

The value of A is up to the designer. If it's selected as 100, for instance,
total HP gains from potions will get closer and closer to 100 as more and more
potions are consumed, but the hero will never quite reach it.
