A random set of monsters, deterministic based on their ID number, will not throw
a weapon that is usable for both melee and throwing (e.g. dagger, spear) if they
have no other melee weapon. Probably over half of monsters should behave like
this, but some monsters will indeed continue to throw their last dagger at you.
