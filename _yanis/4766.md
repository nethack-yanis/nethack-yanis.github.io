If you kick a wall (or stone terrain), there is a small chance that a rock comes
loose from the wall and drops at your feet, or sometimes from the ceiling, in
which case it hits you on the head.

A drum of earthquake also causes rocks to randomly be shaken loose from the
ceiling in their radius of effect and hit any monster that happens to be on
their square.
