Confused genocide doesn't necessarily genocide your own species; it chooses a random genocidable species (which might be your own) and genocides that. If blessed, it picks a random monster class containing at least one genocidable monster (including @) and genocides that.

Another option is that confused genocide automatically picks a monster you have probably been thinking about, such as the nearest monster you can see (if you can't see any other monsters, you can still see yourself!) or the last monster you saw or killed.
