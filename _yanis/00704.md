Torches, which can be created by dipping a club into a potion of oil. Torches are their own item, not just a "lit club" (though possibly the lamplit flag could be used for this), and have a light radius of 3. Deals additional fire damage to monsters it hits, but may go out. May light the hero on fire if they fall down the stairs with a lit torch in inventory.
