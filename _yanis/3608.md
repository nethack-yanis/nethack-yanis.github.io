Items in a bones pile, in addition to being cursed, could be subject to
additional degradation such as erosion, loss of magical charges, or blanking.
(Though since a new player will arrive in the bones level apparently immediately
after the death, it could be a bit of a stretch to have the items degrade so
much.)
