Alternate god smitings (to go alongside striking with lightning): chaotic gods
or Moloch try to create lava around and underneath you, and neutral gods blast
you in a magical explosion that instakills you if not magic resistant, curses
all your items, strips any charges from charged items and disenchants gear to
something highly negative.
