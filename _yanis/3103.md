Chatting to a peaceful monster can be used to recruit it and make it tame, based on a Charisma roll. However, you only get one attempt per monster; if they don't want to join you, trying again will never work.

Internally, this would probably work by having a new flag "recruitable" on a monster, which is only set to true when a monster generates as peaceful (and is not set at all for certain monster types like shopkeepers and priests). Chatting first checks this flag: a taming attempt is only made if it is true, and it is set to false regardless of the taming outcome.
