Player monsters on the Astral Plane can be named after people on the top ten list (note that they don't all have to be; some can use the same names they have now). Possibly, pick a different name if a player monster would be generated with the player's own name, in order to avoid problems on single-user installs where everyone on the top ten list could have the same name as the player. Then again, that could be cool.
