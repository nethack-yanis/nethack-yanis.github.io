Since lycanthropy is an "abnormal" polymorph, dying while in your wereform kills you completely. (This closes off the silliness of turning into your wereform and throwing your weapon at yourself until you die and turn back to normal).

Possibly, weak lycanthropes such as wererats and werejackals should be removed so that getting infected by one isn't essentially a death sentence.
