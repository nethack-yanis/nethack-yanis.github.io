Give all roles a warning when they might fail to read a spellbook, but make the numbers involved much less useful than the Wizard's warning. (Possibly, just give players "difficult to comprehend" when success chance is less than 100% and nothing else, and buff Wizard warning to add more levels: "somewhat difficult", "difficult", "very difficult", "extremely difficult").
