On the Plane of Fire, run a rudimentary cellular automaton to make the lava
slosh around, with a couple rules like "won't encroach on radius 1 or 2 from the
portal" and "there should be no net gain or loss of lava across the whole
level". It being static and the same every time except for the portal location
is rather boring.
