New spell "seek item", mid to high level divination. When cast, you are
prompted to name an object type (or use the wish prompt to allow more details
to be specified - i.e. a +5 broadsword as opposed to any broadsword). Then the
entire dungeon is searched for matching items and tells you where they are
found, probably just telling you the level for objects not on the current level
and showing you the locations of objects a la object detection if they are on
the current level.
