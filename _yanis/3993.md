Allow wielding some types of traditional magical implements to reduce spell
failure rates:
* Wielding a quarterstaff confers the same benefit as wearing a robe but does
  not stack with it.
* Wielding a wand of nothing confers the same benefit as wearing a robe but does
  not stack with it.
* Wielding an identified wand which matches a spell (wand of light -> spell of
  light, wand of death -> finger of death, etc) drastically reduces your failure
  rate when casting it. Perhaps casting the spell while wielding the matching
  unidentified wand should identify the wand.
