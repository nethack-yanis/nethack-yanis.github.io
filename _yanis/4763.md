Remove the ring of levitation from the game, because it trivializes too many
interesting problems - crossing water and lava, fighting monsters that can drown
with impunity, avoiding trap doors and holes, freely crossing the Planes of Air
and Fire - for the fairly low "cost" of one ring slot. Other gear alternatives
to the ring such as levitation boots and the amulet of flying occupy more
valuable slots and therefore aren't as big of an issue.
