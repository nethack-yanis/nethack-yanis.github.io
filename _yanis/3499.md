When selecting top-10 names from the high score list (for player monster
statues, etc), continue looking down the list until 10 unique player names have
been found, rather than choosing from the top 10 scorers. So if the top 10
scorers are cluttered up with the same player in multiple runs, there will still
be some name diversity.
