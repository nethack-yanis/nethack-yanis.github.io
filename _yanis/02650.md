You can use booze potions to clean off your wounds, helping you recover faster. Poison wounds, specifically, though this is debatable because 1) the game doesn't track wounds you got from poison and 2) alcohol can help treat infections, whereas poison isn't an infection.

Healers should probably be able to do this more successfully than other roles.
