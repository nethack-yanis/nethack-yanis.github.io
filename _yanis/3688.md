A variant monk role, or a "specialization" picked at some early level such as 3
or 5, which is a weapons-using monk. Has the same or a slightly reduced capacity
for spellcasting and gains weapon skill caps at the expense of reducing martial
arts's cap to Skilled or Expert. Still has a body armor penalty.
