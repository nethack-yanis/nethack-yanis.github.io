The more gold you pay to a priest, the stronger his pantheon becomes. Newly generated priests from that pantheon could get better equipment, or altars of that god might be harder to convert. In Moloch's case, Gehennom gets slightly harder if you pour a lot of gold into his temple. This applies to your own pantheon as well, but the effects are not as visible.
