New special room "cursed graveyard". Its initial generation is the same as a regular graveyard. The difference is that it generates undead monsters on open spaces in the graveyard (with messages like "A zombie claws out of the ground!") at a much higher frequency than normal, so long as there is still a gravestone existing within the graveyard. When all gravestones in the graveyard are destroyed, the room converts to a normal graveyard and undead stop spawning.

Gravestone texts in a cursed graveyard don't draw from the regular pool of gallows-humor messages. They instead use a separate pool of ominous, vengeful, and threatening messages.

Regular gravestone-destroying penalties do not apply if the gravestone being destroyed is in a cursed graveyard.

Priests can destroy a headstone in a cursed graveyard by #turning while standing on it.
