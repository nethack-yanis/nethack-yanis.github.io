To nerf the strategy of dropping the Amulet to cast spells, but not to the point of UnNetHack's teleporting it anywhere on the level, it teleports randomly within a fixed radius every time it's dropped. (Possibly on the Astral Plane it always teleports away from the nearest high altar, so you can't use it to jump ahead.)
