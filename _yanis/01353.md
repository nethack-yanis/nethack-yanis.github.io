Give potions more side dipping effects:
* Dipping an eroded item in a healing potion repairs erosion on it; 1 level for regular healing, 2 for extra healing, and 3 for full healing. Restore ability will repair all erosion as well.
* Dipping a negatively enchanted item in a restore ability potion reverts it to +0 if the potion is blessed, adds 1 point if uncursed, and does nothing if cursed.
* Dipping an enchantable item in a gain ability potion enchants it (by 1 point, always).
