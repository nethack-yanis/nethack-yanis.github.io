Region of reverse gravity: while inside the region you gain levitation if you
don't have it, or lose levitation if you do have it. This means if you want to
pick something up off the floor, you would quaff a potion of levitation. If
implemented as a separate effect on top of levitation, you might have no control
over your movements, as you do on the Plane of Air - magical sources of
levitation give you control over your movements there, but in order to be
levitating in a reversed-gravity area you *cannot have any levitation magic.*

Not specified what effect would create the region.
