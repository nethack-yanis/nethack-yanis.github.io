There is some ritual you can do that allows you to manually create the portal to
Fort Ludios. It requires the sacrifice of at least 10000 zorkmids, possibly some
special item that is only generated somewhere below Medusa, and that you be in a
vault. If the portal to Ludios already generated, this will always fail (it
won't make a second portal).
