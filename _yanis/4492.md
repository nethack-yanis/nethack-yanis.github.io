Support blood splatters with no particular associated monster type (NON_PM).
Such splatters will render as nondescript blood.

When saving a bones file, go through all the blood splatters on the level and
set them to this nonspecific type. This avoids a bit of weirdness where a new
adventurer enters the bones file, sees the splatters, and can immediately
identify what type of monster each one came from.
