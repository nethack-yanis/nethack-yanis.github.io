To balance the 3.7.0 rule change in which monsters don't death-drop comestibles,
add a new monster, gingerbread man.
- It is a golem made of cram rations, which it drops on death.
- Its stats are unimpressive combat-wise, but fast.
- It might have a special "can't catch me" AI rule that always tries to flee
  from the player.
