Pits created by freezing water and then digging out the ice gradually and
randomly fill back in with water. But if you then try to frost walk on them
(with water walking boots and white dragon scale mail), you get the following:
"The water crackles and freezes under your weight. The ice breaks under your
weight! You fall into your pit!" creating the pit anew on the space.
