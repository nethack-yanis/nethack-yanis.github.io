Add in master lichens as a real monster, which are only a bit more threatening
than normal lichens (maybe speed 2 or 3, have a passive sticky attack like
mimics) but have an increased difficulty so that they generate deeper in the
Dungeons, and are a source of nonrotting corpses. Possibly, the passive sticky
attack should also be given to regular lichens.
