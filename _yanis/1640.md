Fairies, a white <span class="nhsym clr-white">n</span> monster similar to pixies: very small, flying, capable of hiding under objects. However, they are lawfully aligned and possibly always generated peaceful. If you chat to a non-hostile fairy, it will heal you a moderate amount (as in the Legend of Zelda) and become cancelled (a cancelled fairy can no longer heal you).
