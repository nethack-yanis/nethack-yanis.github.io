Artifact suit of armor (type is unspecified, perhaps a ring mail or chain mail)
that is unaligned and operates like magic armor in the Legend of Zelda. When
worn, it drains your gold at a constant rate, and when you take damage, you
lose a somewhat randomized amount of gold, in exchange for partially or
completely negating the damage. Gold is consumed at some rate higher than 1 per
turn, and it is lost for damage at some rate higher than 1 per hit point.

If you have no gold while wearing it, you become either very slow or very
encumbered.

Croesus may occasionally generate wearing this armor, along with some gold to
supply it. Otherwise it generates like any unaligned artifact.
