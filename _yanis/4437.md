Artifact suit of armor (type is unspecified, perhaps a ring mail or chain mail)
that is unaligned and operates like magic armor in the Legend of Zelda. When
worn, it drains your gold at a constant rate, and when you take damage, you
lose a somewhat randomized amount of gold, in exchange for partially or
completely negating the damage (perhaps the easiest way to do this is via half
physical damage, since it doesn't make much sense for armor to protect against
e.g. poison damage from drinking a potion of sickness). Gold is consumed at some
rate higher than 1 per turn, and it is lost for damage at some rate higher than
1 per hit point.

If you have no gold while wearing it, you become either very slow or very
encumbered, and it ceases to reduce or negate damage.

Croesus may occasionally generate wearing this armor, along with some gold to
supply it. Otherwise it generates like any unaligned artifact.
