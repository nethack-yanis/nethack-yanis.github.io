Grass terrain, rendered as a green period or comma. It could have the following
properties:
* Dies and turns to normal floor if hit by fire or have a death ray zapped over
  it.
* Turns into fire terrain if hit by fire and can spread to nearby grass.
* You can plant trees on them, whereas you cannot do this on normal floor.
* Small monsters that are capable of hiding under objects can hide in grass.
