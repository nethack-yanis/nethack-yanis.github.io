The spell of knock, if cast at a container while Skilled or Expert, should
disarm any trap on the container. However, this breaks the consumable-renewable
principle (a spell that costs 5 Pw being a free untrap for containers is
powerful), so maybe it should be given to the wand of opening instead, and to
avoid it being better than the invoke power of the Master Key of Thievery, it
should still set off the container trap.
