Revenant race. Only available for roles you have died playing and didn't leave bones. Gets death-magic resistance and unbreathing from XL1, has an automatic counterattacking kick. Does not have starting gear; any starting gear your role has is scattered randomly across dungeon level 1. Cannot start with a pet.
