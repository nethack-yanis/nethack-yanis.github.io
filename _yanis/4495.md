New 'Soldier' role. You start with various gear typically issued to soldiers: a
basic weapon or two, basic armor, some K-rations etc. The quest involves working
with other soldiers to defend a castle (probably not THE Castle?) from
adventurers. Other army members would be generated peaceful.

Another take on this is a "Defector" role in which you have defected or escaped
from the Yendorian Army. The starting gear would be the same, but the quest
would probably involve sabotaging the army somehow.
