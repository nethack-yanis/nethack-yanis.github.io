Add the following events on Halloween:
- The normal "midnight" effects should begin at 6 PM.
- Intelligent monsters may generate peaceful and with candy bars, which they
  will give to you when you chat to them. Or possibly, this only happens with
  monsters that have "homes" such as shopkeepers, priests, and peaceful Minetown
  inhabitants. (Not specified what happens if a monster generates with a candy
  bar, but you save the game and come back to talk to them once it's no longer
  Halloween.)
- Other monsters have a higher than normal chance of generating with attack
  wands.
