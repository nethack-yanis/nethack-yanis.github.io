Shuffle trap: randomly relocates all the traps on the level.

Not specified whether traps with a specific position defined in the level (such
as the Castle trapdoors or Valley dart traps) should remain fixed in place and
only randomly-placed traps get shuffled. Also not specified if rolling boulder
traps should have their boulder move to an appropriate place or not.
