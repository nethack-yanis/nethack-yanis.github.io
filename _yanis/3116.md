Dungeons levels generate random, small Sokoban "rooms" - actually themed rooms, never on a path between the two stairs, possibly using "diagonaloban" rules which permit boulders to be rolled in any direction. There is a minor prize in each room at the end of the puzzle.

Internally, rooms like this should have their own room type, which will help with putting in anti-cheating measures:
* You cannot teleport into a square whose room type is this room. (Teleporting out of the room should be fine.) Likewise, the room is not a valid destination for arriving on the level via levelport, falling from above, etc.
* The walls are nondiggable and non-phaseable.
* Air currents are in effect over pits/holes in this room type.
* The room should have a narrow entrance with a bend in it, so that boulders can't be pushed in from elsewhere on the level.

It's unclear what the methods to prevent the standard forms of cheating (breaking boulders, reading scrolls of earth, carrying boulders as a giant, etc) should be. Possibly they will just carry cheating penalties like normal.
