Replace the mysterious force with "dark energy", which starts pooling from the high altar of Moloch soon after you get the Amulet, and thereafter from the downstairs of a given level. If you are caught by the dark energy, you start taking a bunch of damage, limiting the amount of time you can spend on levels after getting the Amulet.
