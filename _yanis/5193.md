Several potential additions for the clerical spell school:
- Bless: this could either be a low-level spell that works like it does in D&D
  where it gives you a to-hit and damage bonus, or it could be a high-level
  spell that blesses an item. Possibly it could bless items when cast at Skilled
  or above.
- Sanctuary: a medium-level spell that effectively makes monsters treat the 3x3
  area around you like a coaligned temple for a limited time, unless you take a
  hostile action which ends the spell.
- Command: Drop: forces a monster to drop its weapon.
- Inflict Wounds: medium-level spell that deals damage while being in the
  clerical school. Damage should probably scale with skill.
- Hold Person: paralyzes a monster (or more strictly, a humanoid); fits right in
  since enemy priests can already cast this.
- Silence: Temporarily stops a monster from reading a scroll or casting a spell.
  Not specified if this should be a debuff or create a region of silence.
- Dispel Magic: Removes magical effects from a monster or multiple monsters.
  May be of limited use unless added to a variant where monster magic buffs are
  significant.
- Freedom of Movement: Grants temporary intrinsic free action, allowing you to
  free up a ring slot.
