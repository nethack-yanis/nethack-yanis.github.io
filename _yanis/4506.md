You should be able to #tip potions onto your own square or onto an adjacent
square. When tipped, it causes vapor effects to all monsters in the 3x3 area
around that square, including yourself, and also causes "potion on skin" effects
to the monster it was tipped onto. Some potions may not have such an effect
beyond their vapors, but ones like polymorph, acid, and healing ought to.

Among other things, this provides a way to administer polymorph or healing
potions to a pet without attacking it with a wielded potion.
