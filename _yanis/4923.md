Add a means of enchanting terrain features to work to the player's benefit. For
instance, enchanted doors could open automatically as you approach them, then
lock themselves behind you to stop monsters who are chasing you. Enchanted
altars, meanwhile, could move nearby corpses onto themselves so there is no need
to carry them or finagle killing very heavy monsters exactly on the altar.
