In order to penalize situations where the hero is partly or mostly surrounded
without implemeting a complex flanking system: Every monster attack that incurs
damage reduction due to subzero AC makes your effective AC worse by the amount
of reduced damage for the duration of that turn. This means that a crowd of
monsters hitting you all at once will whittle down your defense and do some
damage rather than damage reduction being in full force for each individual
attack.
