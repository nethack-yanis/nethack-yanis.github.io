Intrinsic teleportitis is no longer binary; you build it up by getting the intrinsic from multiple corpses. With more of it built up, the random teleports happen more frequently. However, the effect wears off over time and eventually fades completely (with some message like "You feel less jumpy", so the hero knows they can't Ctrl-T at will anymore).

This implementation meshes well with a partial intrinsic system like in SporkHack or EvilHack.
