Gradually, over time, you lose points of Charisma due to accumulating dirt and scars and generally looking worse. This can be fixed with the usual restore ability methods, by entering water (possibly sitting on fountains should do this), by getting hit by a rust trap (this only restores one point at a time), or by #wiping with a towel (which may have limited effectiveness).
