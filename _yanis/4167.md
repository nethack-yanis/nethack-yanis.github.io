Boots of fleeing: they give bonus movement points based on how many turns ago
your last offensive action was (offensive actions are things that would fade an
Elbereth underneath you). For the first several turns after combat they grant no
speed bonus, then gradually scale up to full speed. This means that remaining in
combat grants you no speed advantage but lets you travel very fast if you avoid
it.
