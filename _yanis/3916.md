On occasion, a small mimic poses as a spellbook so persuasively that it actually
is a spellbook item, and you can pick it up and carry it around. Attempting to
identify, read, throw or kick the book reveals it as a mimic. (If mimics have
been genocided, this silently doesn't happen.)

Internally this is stored using the book's otrapped flag.
