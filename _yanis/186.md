Attempt to address the problem of ascension kits always converging on the same
few usually wished-up items by making the highest-tier, really good quality, +8
or +9 gear be generated on the toughest monsters or even bosses deep in
Gehennom. The high enchantment makes it incredibly hard to get through normal
means, even if the base gear is wished for elsewhere. Overall end-game
difficulty would need a bump if the average player is expected to pick up and
use some of this gear.
