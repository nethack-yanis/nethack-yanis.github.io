Some Medusa buffs:
* Allow her to swim. (She can already fly, so this may not do much.)
* Give her a wrapping attack, flavored as crushing coils, which could possibly
  drown you.
* Her gaze has a reduced effect if you have reflection and not blindness, but
  not zero effect. Perhaps it begins slow-stoning rather than instant stoning.
