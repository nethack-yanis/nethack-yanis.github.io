New type of book "encyclopedia":
* Hardback book when unidentified, base price 300.
* Nonmagical and always polypiles into a blank spellbook.
* When read, it adds the appearance of some unknown magical items (1d4 if blessed, 1d3 if uncursed, 1 if cursed, plus 1 if you are an Archeologist) to your discovery list.
* It doesn't disappear when read, but will set a flag that prevents its effects from happening again. This flag will be cleared when creating a bones file.
* Archeologists start with a special blessed encyclopedia (using a different flag), which is their research (the starting one comes pre-read and isn't useful to this character): reading an unread archeologist encyclopedia gives the message "These seem to be an archeologist's notes. You pore over them intently.", and type-IDs two unknown scrolls, rings, amulets, and wands, and puts two blessed scrolls of magic mapping into your inventory.
* The Archeologist home level contains another encyclopedia.
