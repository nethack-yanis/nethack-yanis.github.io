The scroll of gold detection, if read when confused (and cursed, possibly),
detects silver items instead of gold pieces.

It's probably desirable to keep the existing effect of trap detection in some
form, so it's a bit tricky to decide exactly which combinations of cursed and
confused should keep that and which should detect silver.
