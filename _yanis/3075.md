New magic beam trap, which fires a magic beam (probably implemented as a magic missile ray, or possibly a random ray type) from a fixed point several squares away in one of the eight directions towards the trap square.

Internally, the fixed point is stored in the trap's launch coordinates, and the ray type should probably be stored as the appropriate wand type in launch_otyp.
