Provide "organic" lighting to dark rooms via a luminescent fungus:
- Level 0 monster, with a 0 difficulty rating.
- Sessile, has no movement.
- Has no attacks (not even passive ones).
- Sheds light in a radius of 1 or 2 around it.
- It would only be able to generate on a square that is dark, but would have
  special cases to generate out of its ordinary expected depth since most dark
  rooms spawn later in the dungeon. Still, they would ideally taper off
- Since it is completely nonthreatening, it would be level 0 and worth 0
  experience points, but killing it would still break pacifist conduct.
- The corpse could function as a light source, but that might be too annoying to
  implement.
- If the idea is to have a lot of them, they should probably have pretty low
  corpse nutrition, to avoid unbalancing the nutrition balance. The corpses
  would rot anyway, but they would be vegetarian and suitable food for horses
  and other such pets. Alternatively, the corpse could be poisonous.
- Might need special pet checks to prevent pets from killing the fungus.
