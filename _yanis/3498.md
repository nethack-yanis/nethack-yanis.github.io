Fix vampires shifting into fog clouds as an escape method because this doesn't
currently work with fog clouds being slow and easily killed.
* Normal fog clouds can still be slow, but vampshifted fog clouds should have
  their regular form's speed.
* Fog clouds in general should be very hard to land a hit on, with "your attack
  passes harmlessly through" like a ghost nearly all the time (allowing critical
  hits only?), or all of the time, if you are not engulfed. Fog clouds that are
  fleeing, like vampires running away, will not engulf the player.
* If a vampshifted fog cloud is pinned down and has nowhere to go, it can pass
  through the squares of a number of monsters blocking its way and land
  somewhere else, provided that space is within a few spaces. This prevents the
  player from trapping it in a corner and beating it to death.
* At some point, the vampire must turn itself back to normal, and not stay in
  fog cloud form forever.
