When the player is Weak or Fainting and uses the eat command when they have
nothing to eat, the game searches through any carried containers to see if they
have any food stored away in them, and if so give them a hint to check those
containers.

It's intended as a parallel to the "Perhaps you have some gold stashed away?"
hint given when attempting to pay in a shop with insufficient money but money
stashed in containers.
