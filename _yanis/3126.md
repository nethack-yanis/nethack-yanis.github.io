Make the game able to bind the arrow keys (and other escape sequences like home/pageup) to commands. These keys send an escape character plus some other characters following it. Since escape is currently a no-op, it would now instead go into "listening mode" for those character sequences, and be able to parse them.

The downside is that it would now be impossible to distinguish this from hitting Escape followed by the other characters sent afterwards.
