The dunce cap inhibits spellcasting (on top of the low intelligence it provides;
not specified if it should entirely block spellcasting or just make it very
difficult) but also provides magic resistance when worn. This is to add
diversity of non-artifact magic resistance builds for non-spellcasters, and also
to allow people to give magic resistance to pets that are incapable of wearing
cloaks.
