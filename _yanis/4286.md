New artifact _The Golden Knight_, a gold small shield that has the following
properties:
* Sets strength to 25 when worn like gauntlets of power.
* Cannot be invoked directly, but if you fall below 25% of your HP maximum when
  your invoke timeout is good, it automatically invokes itself to take half of
  your current Pw points and heal you for that much HP.

If this doesn't seem powerful enough, remove its strength effect and make the
base item a shield of reflection instead.
