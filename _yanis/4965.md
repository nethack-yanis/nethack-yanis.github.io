One potential fix for resolving a connection hangup when a player is being
prompted for a wish (a surprisingly common problem): there should be a variable
in program_state which is set to true when the player is prompted for a wish,
and set to false when they receive the item from the wish. If the game is
restored and this flag is true, the player should immediately be prompted for a
wish.
