Candle additions:
* Wielding a candle gives it a light radius of 3 (at the obvious expense of not having a weapon).
* Hitting enemies with a lit candle (thrown or melee) has an 80% chance of extinguishing the flame and a 20% chance of lighting them on fire, doing 2d3 fire damage.
* A lit candle can be applied to an adjacent burnable object (door, tree, wood golem, paper golem) to light it on fire.
