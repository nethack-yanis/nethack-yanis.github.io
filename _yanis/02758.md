Make potions lighter, on the order of 5-10 aum, on the basis that potions are one-time use and one-time use objects shouldn't be heavier than many pieces of armor, and also on the realism basis that at their current weight, they're a few liters of liquid. The counterargument is that if potions are lightweight, there's less to prevent the hero from scooping up everything in the dungeon as they go.
