Spell of probing, in the divination school, that probes monsters based on skill:
* Unskilled limits it to touch range and gives minimal information on the
  monster's status, possibly only showing HP like a stethoscope.
* Basic is still touch range but gives the usual amount of information.
* Skilled shoots a probing beam and gives some additional information.
* Expert allows you to select any space or monster in your line of sight within
  a radius, and gives the same information as Skilled.

The wand of probing is raised to be on par with the Skilled effects.
