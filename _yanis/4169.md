Make the ring of conflict chargeable, with the enchantment serving as a timer:
when worn, the enchantment slowly ticks back towards +0, and the ring ceases to
provide conflict when it's +0. Negatively enchanted rings tick up in enchantment
towards +0. Being cursed doesn't affect this, it only prevents you from removing
the ring as is standard.
