Add Sokoban levels with a pinball-inspired mechanic: some of the walls are a new
"bumper" terrain type. An object or creature that moves into a bumper will be
hurled away from the bumper in a non-random direction (which could be straight
back in the direction it came, always at a 90 degree angle, or vary based on the
particular bumper). The puzzles involve moving boulders into the bumpers to
propel them in ways regular pushing can't accomplish.
