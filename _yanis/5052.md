A system in which dwarf heroes gain experience by carrying a lot of gold, or
lose experience by carrying little gold. More specifically, if your total number
of experience points is less than the amount of gold pieces you are currently
carrying, you gain 1 experience point per turn, and if greater, you lose 1
experience point per turn. You gain or lose an experience level as normal
whenever this brings you across a threshold for one.
