Prevent giants from accidentally moving on top of a boulder in Sokoban, which
incurs a luck penalty. This is probably most easily done by only allowing them
to move on top of an unpushable boulder by prefixing the move with m.

Another possibility is just to prevent giants from stepping onto boulders in
Sokoban at all, giving a message "The ceiling is too low for you to step over
this boulder."
