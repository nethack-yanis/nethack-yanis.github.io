Mirrors carried openly in your inventory act as a weak source of reflection:
if you have no other source of reflection, they will block an incoming ray
(possibly only a death ray), at the expense of breaking and costing you 2 points
of luck as breaking a mirror usually does, except if your luck is already
negative it won't be penalized further. Arguably it shouldn't apply a luck
penalty at all unless the player caused the ray; after all, you aren't punished
for a monster zapping a wand of striking and breaking a mirror on the ground.

This would allow better protection against random attack wands early in the
game, when mirrors can be found but a permanent reflection source is rare.
