Restructure elemental resistances so it's no longer possible to have a full 100%
resistance to any element.

Instead of having gradual percentage-based resistances that you can build up
over time, classify resistances into 4 discrete steps:
1. No resistance.
2. Resistance from eating things. Reduces 50% of damage from that element, and
   your items are still subject to being destroyed if it's fire, cold, or shock.
3. Resistance from role or race. Reduces 75% of damage from that element, and
   your items are still subject to destruction.
4. Resistance from an extrinsic source like a ring or dragon armor. Reduces 90%
   of damage from that element, and your items are shielded from destruction.

A possible fifth step is immunity to the element, at which 100% of damage is
negated and your items are shielded. This should either not exist at all, or if
it is, it should only come from very rare sources, like a few artifacts.
