Add an anosmia status condition, in which you have no sense of smell:
* Tins cannot be identified by their smell, unless they contain spinach or are
  empty.
* Messages involving smell, such as when you cast stone to flesh on rocks, are
  suppressed.
* Food detection scrolls and the spell of detect food don't work.
* Food appraisal doesn't work.

Not specified what things in the game might cause this condition, or if it
should be a roleplay birth option.
