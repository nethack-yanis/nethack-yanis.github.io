New object type "boots of burden", magical boots which increase your carrying
capacity by 50% when worn.

A realistic implementation would mean the boots cease to work when you begin
levitating or flying even if you are still wearing them, but this may be too
tricky to implement given that the carry cap change may need to prevent the hero
from leaving the ground in some circumstances, and the game needs to concisely
tell them why.
