Skeletons should only have partial stoning resistance. If they would become
petrified, their bones do petrify, which leaves them still mobile but slowed
down, and unable to be cured by speed monster. (This does raise the question of
what happens if you cast stone to flesh at the petrified skeleton - does it
create a "meat skeleton" or just restore its ordinary bones?)
