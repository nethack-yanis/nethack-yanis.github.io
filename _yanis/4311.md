Cursed potions of invisibility remove any permanent intrinsic invisibility you
have, but still give you the normal cursed duration of temporary intrinsic
invisibility, so after that duration you will become visible again. Thus, they
are a controllable way to remove the permanent intrinsic and are also still
useful for characters without invisibility yet.
