Potionless conduct, which prohibits the hero from using or breaking a potion
(i.e. quaffing them, dipping things into them, throwing them; also breaking them
with a force bolt). Monsters throwing potions at you or breaking potions with
force bolts do not break the conduct even if you breathe the vapors, which does
mean there's some possibility for abuse in putting a potion on the ground and
giving a nearby intelligent monster a wand of striking, but the alternative is
too strict.
