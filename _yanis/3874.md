Conceptually separate breath weapons from rays, making them not trivially
reflectable. Make it possible to suffer reduced effects from a breath weapon,
with the size of a worn shield a factor in that reduction.

Possibly make dragon armor of the same type as a given breath weapon (e.g. red
dragon armor versus fire breath) reflect that breath weapon, and only that one.
