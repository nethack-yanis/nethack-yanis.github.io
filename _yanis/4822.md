When you wish for an artifact that already exists and fail to get it, the game
should either hint at or outright tell you the location where the artifact was
generated so you can go track it down.

Do this by saving the X, Y, and Z coordinates at which the artifact was created
when it gets generated. If the artifact happens to get uncreated, like as part
of level generation, the saved coordinates should be reset, because the artifact
is then able to be generated again.
