Take the "Caveman's role strength should be having stats through the roof" idea
to an extended version: not only should they have higher physical stat maximums
than pretty much everyone else, but they should also get an increased melee
damage bonus, a higher HP maximum, and a higher carrying capacity.

To compensate for this, they could be made illiterate by being incapable of
reading anything.
