Your discoveries list is presented as a menu rather than a fixed list of every single thing you have discovered. The menu contains the subcategories that the current long list is organized into (weapons, scrolls, gems etc), which will let you view that subset of your discoveries. There's also an option provided to view all the discoveries at once if you want to view that. Possibly this feature should be controlled by an option.
