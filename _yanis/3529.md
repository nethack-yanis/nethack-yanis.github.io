When you approach Mephisto and he is still peaceful, he does not demand tribute
to pass like normal. Instead, he offers to buy your soul in exchange for
powerful assistance on your quest to get the Amulet. If you agree, you are given
amazing combat advantages (huge intrinsic damage boost, huge intrinsic AC boost,
etc).

One of two bad things can happen as a result:
1. You have some chance, maybe 1/3, of failing to ascend when offering the
   Amulet to your god, as Mephisto claims your soul (the god still gets the
   Amulet but cannot raise you to immortality, so it's a weird "win" that is not
   an ascension).
2. While ascending through Gehennom with the Amulet, he may reappear and try to
   take it and everything else for himself. All buffs he gave you are instantly
   removed and perhaps some debuffs are even applied. Possibly, defeating him in
   this circumstance could yield your soul back.

Alternatively he might appear on Astral, but that could be hard to explain
flavor-wise. Or just create some test for if the player is in a sufficiently
dire condition, and when they are he claims the player's soul.

If you already have the Amulet the first time you meet Mephisto, he may not
offer a bargain at all.
