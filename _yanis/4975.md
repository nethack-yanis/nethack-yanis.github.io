Poison gas trap, which creates a cloud of poison gas around its space. It has a
short life, only triggering a few times before it runs out of supply. You might
be able to untrap it to get a scroll of stinking cloud or potion of sickness.

This is a narrower version of #4453 which doesn't require any refactoring or new
types of gas clouds.
