If you fall through a hole or trap door onto a level, and there is a trapper or
lurker above in the area you are eligible to arrive in (because some levels
constrain the region you can arrive in), you automatically land on its space and
get instantly engulfed by it (with a message stating as much). This is flavored
as the monster lurking by the shaft in order to catch easy prey.
