If you put too many wands in the same place (inventory, bag, stash, floor pile,
etc), there should be a risk that the magic in them will reach a critical mass
that sets them off and blows some of them up. This would destroy only wands, not
any other type of objects stored with them.

The intent is to address a balance issue with wands where the player steadily
accumulates them over the game and has a huge arsenal of them, many of which
aren't even that useful, by the late game.
