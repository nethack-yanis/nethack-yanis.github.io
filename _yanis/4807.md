Knights should be given a tame ki-rin from their god when they get crowned.
Possibly only if they have enhanced their riding skill; a knight who hasn't
enhanced it probably wants some other gift. Since ki-rin are lawful, a knight
who has converted to some other alignment and is being crowned by a non-lawful
god probably should not be granted one.
