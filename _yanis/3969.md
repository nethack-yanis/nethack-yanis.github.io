In a lot of folklore, iron wards away elves. This could be implemented in the
game in several ways:
* Elves take extra damage when hit by iron. Not as much as silver, but still
  appreciable.
* Elven players take a small amount of damage when putting on or wielding iron
  gear, but get no further penalty. (dnethack hurts their regeneration rate
  while wearing iron, which is another option).
* Possibly some detrimental effect when wielding iron weapons as well, a to-hit
  or damage penalty, or negating bonuses from dexterity, strength, and skill, or
  something.
* This is balanced by elven racial equipment being better (not improved; it's
  already better).
