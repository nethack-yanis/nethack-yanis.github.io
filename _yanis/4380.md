Reimagine the Rogue quest plot where the quest artifact is owned by a rich guy
and you're sent on a mission to steal it, sneaking into his estate, bypassing
all his security guards and systems, and covertly entering his mansion.

Ideally, it would require cunning and inventiveness like the current quest
does, not simply being a quest you can slaughter your way through. It could
still use the idea of having the entry point and destination on a level be in
disconnected areas of the map separated by non-phaseable walls.

The nemesis can be made weak and trivial to kill if you actually get to him
(because he is just a fat old rich guy), with the possible exception of if you
get noticed by or kill him, he will call in all his backup to stop you.

For this to work, the quest artifact would probably have to be changed from the
Master Key of Thievery to something else that a collector would have.
Alternatively, the goal of the quest could just be a macguffin, with the quest
leader having the Master Key of Thievery and they exchange it for the macguffin
when you return with it.
