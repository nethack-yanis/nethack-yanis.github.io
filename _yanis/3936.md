You can use a crystal ball to search for an artifact. It will not tell you where
it is, but it will show you a "cloudy" image of the artifact if it already
exists, and an "empty" image if it does not yet exist. Maybe also tell the
player explicitly "It means this artifact is/is not anywhere in the dungeon
right now."
