Make the Oracle consultation prompts more obvious as to what they're getting. "Dost thou wish to hear the latest dungeon gossip?" / "Then dost thou desire a serious piece of advice?" Also, it should ask the player even if they have no money, and tell them that they don't have enough after the prompts are shown.
