Make it so that you never forget spells, but you have a hard limit on the number
of spells you can know at any time (except possibly for Wizards; the limit could
vary from role to role). Not specified if you could still learn new spells and
forget old ones to make room like move sets in Pokemon, or if you're locked into
knowing the first N spells you learn in the game. It's also OK for amnesia
effects to cause spells to be forgotten.
