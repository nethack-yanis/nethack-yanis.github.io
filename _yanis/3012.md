A monster in the n or perhaps W classes whose main gimmick is that they will dodge or short-range teleport out of the way whenever they see an attack coming. In order to fight them effectively, you can't be straightforward in attacking. You can use displacement, ray-bouncing, or invisibility (but they'll recognize you're using that pretty fast and adjust tactics accordingly).
