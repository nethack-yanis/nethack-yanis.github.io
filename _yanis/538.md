Make death magic resistable by an amulet or ring. Possible names and corresponding exact effects vary:
* "life protection" (bad name, life saving is very similar)
* "unliving" (makes you not count as living and life saving won't work)
* "undeath" (actively makes you count as undead, you are vulnerable to turn undead effects and lawful gods may be annoyed at you)
* "versus death magic"
