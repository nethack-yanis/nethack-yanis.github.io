Combine force bolts and digging beams. Specifically:
* Remove the wand of striking and the spell of force bolt.
* Roles that start with force bolt instead start with magic missile and at least
  10 maximum Pw.
* All current environment interactions of force bolts (breaking boulders and
  statues, crashing open doors, etc) are moved to digging beams.
* Make digging beams affect monsters, with a guaranteed hit and fixed 6d12
  damage from the spell (since it would be level 5), less damage from a digging
  wand.
