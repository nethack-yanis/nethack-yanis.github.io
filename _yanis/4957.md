Add a "classical mechanic" monster as a counterpart to the quantum mechanic. It
has a unique attack strategy; if it's not in melee, it will rush towards you all
at once and send you flying when it collides. This is an elastic collision that
conserves momentum, so how far you are sent flying depends on how far it
traveled to reach you and your relative masses.

If it is in melee range, it has a melee attack that drains your magic energy to
make itself stronger, but if you subsequently kill it and eat its corpse, you
regain exactly as much energy as you lost (conservation of energy). They also
mutually grudge quantum mechanics.
