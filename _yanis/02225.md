When you escape the dungeon by leaving on the level 1 stairs without the Amulet, your god is immediately set to be angry at you (for abandoning their mission). This will have no effect on the game since it's ending, but end-of-game enlightenment will show that they were angry with you. Possibly disable this if the hero had the Amulet at some point or is carrying an unidentified fake one.
