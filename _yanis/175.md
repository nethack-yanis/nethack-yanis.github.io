Saddlebags, a rarely generated container that can be applied to a saddled mount
and then have gear put into it, allowing the player to offload some of their
weight onto the mount. While they are as nonmagical as a sack, they have a
higher base cost and weight. You can loot it on an adjacent mount by using the
directional #loot command. Knights may start with one.
