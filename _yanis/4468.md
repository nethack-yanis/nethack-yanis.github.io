Artifact horn of plenty that gives slow digestion when carried and never needs
to be recharged; however, it never dispenses potions because allowing the player
to get infinite potions is obviously not a great idea.

It's been noted that an artifact such as this makes it so you never need food
again, removes that aspect of gameplay, and should therefore probably only
appear very late in the game.
