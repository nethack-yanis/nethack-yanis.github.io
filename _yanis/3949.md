Several new objects for aiding in alchemy:
* Flask, holds multiple quaffs of a single potion type (so that holy water can't
  be mass-created but other potions can).
* Mortar and pestle, can grind gems / other things into dust which can be used
  to make potions.
* Alembic, can distill potions from things in the dungeon such as corpses.
* Recipe books/scrolls, which tell the reader how to create a certain potion
  through alchemy, and identifies the result potion or even all potions
  involved.
