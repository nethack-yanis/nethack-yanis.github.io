Tortles should be allowed to wear rigid external armor pieces: gloves, hats, and
boots. Wearing any will either prevent them from retreating into their shell, or
will fall off if they try to. (Possibly both - if the ordinary behavior is for
them to fall off, a cursed piece of armor would presumably prevent them from
retreating into the shell.)
