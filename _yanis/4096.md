Add a #pour command, which allows you to pour a potion on your own or an
adjacent space. This allows you to do things like pour healing potions on your
pet rather than smashing them with it, possibly pouring acid and other harmful
potions on adjacent monsters, pouring water on fire elementals and other fiery
monsters, etc.
