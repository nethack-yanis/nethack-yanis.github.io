Invisibility should work completely when the invisible monster and the detecting
monster are far apart, but when within 5 (or 4?) squares of each other, its
location should be known to within 1 space (fuzzing the real location by 1 space
in all directions). When the invisible monster takes a direct offensive action,
or with some probability when it is adjacent, its position should become known.
It should still appear as I, but the I will move wherever the monster goes until
it becomes 5 or more spaces away, at which point invisibility should once again
work fully. This could work differently if the invisible monster is stealthy.
