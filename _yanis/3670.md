When you attempt to polymorph an item that has polymorph magic
(wand/spell/potion of polymorph, tin of meat that may cause a polymorph when
eaten, etc) it explodes and creates one or more monsters affiliated with
polymorph magic, such as polymorph vortices (see YANI #3669), genetic engineers,
or similar.
