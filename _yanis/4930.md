Amulet of contingency:
* When you are reduced to critical HP, it auto-uses itself and crumbles to dust,
  and teleports or warps you away to get away from whatever threat you are
  facing.
* Teleportation makes a bit more flavor sense, but warping allows it to be
  effective even on non-teleport levels.
* The destination could be the up stairs, but that could be abused on the
  ascension run. If the amulet is uncommon enough, this could be OK and using
  them to get through a few levels could be a viable tactic. Otherwise, they
  could send you to a random destination, or a random destination from among the
  set of places with no imminently threatening monsters.
* If you die without passing through critical HP range (i.e. any non-HP death,
  or getting hit with a very powerful attack) it does not trigger.
* Possibly, the amulet slot is the wrong one for such an item because most
  people would still probably prefer life saving over it. It could possibly be
  a piece of magical armor, or else be a charged amulet, good for multiple uses.
