Vary the object class generation probabilities at the start of the game.
Probably not too heavily, but adjusting the numbers so there is e.g. a greater
than normal bias towards spellbooks, wands, and armor, and a lower than normal
bias towards rings, weapons, and potions. The idea is that this will lead to
more replayability, since it will be interesting to play a game with shortages
of certain items and surpluses of others.
