"Dragon hoard" themed room: containing a big pile of gold scattered within a
radius of 2-3 tiles around its center point, with larger stacks of gold closer
to the center of the pile. The pile may also contain a few additional items:
random gems, a ring or amulet, (if in an object-materials-implementing variant)
a gold version of an item that is eligible to be gold. Atop the center of the
pile is a dragon, or possibly a few adult dragons all of the same species,
either asleep or flagged as waiting, with possibly a few dragon eggs of the same
species and/or a couple baby dragons.
