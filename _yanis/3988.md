Ideas to change terrain symbols to reduce overcrowding of the # symbol:
* Iron bars and fences render as cyan or brown wall glyphs.
* Sinks render as white or blue \\.
* Closed drawbridges render as some color of + which is not used by many
  spellbooks - perhaps red or orange.
* Corridors could be moved to a period glyph but this would probably be very
  unpopular and make levels look a lot worse.
* Trees could be green +, or possibly green \\ to avoid spellbook confusion.
* Clouds could set the background color of a space and not change the foreground
  color, and could possibly be rendered with a blank space character, but this
  would probably have issues on non-color terminals.
