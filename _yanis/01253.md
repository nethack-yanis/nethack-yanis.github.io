Generalize health food stores into a special type of role-specific shop. This shop isn't an actual shop; it signals the level generator to transform it into a different specific type of shop depending on the player's role. The role-specific shops contain role-helpful items like health food does for Monks. They can be found randomly generated with probability around 5%. If a role doesn't have a specific type of shop associated, the shop becomes a general store instead.
