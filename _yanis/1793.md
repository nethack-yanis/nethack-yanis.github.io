A monster flag that designates that its inventory is actually the contents of its stomach and is therefore not stealable, nor usable by the monster. Gelatinous cubes, rock moles, and purple worms should get this flag. (Also some other proposed "eater" monsters, like the bookworm.)

If a monster (like a purple worm) eats another monster, that monster's inventory should be added into the eater's stomach.
