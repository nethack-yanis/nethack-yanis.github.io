Conflict should cause monsters to prioritize moving toward and attacking
targets they would attack anyway (like the player) over targets they wouldn't
(like other monsters), instead of it being fully random.

The purpose of this is to maintain the offensive use of conflict (monsters deal
damage to each other) while nerfing the defensive use of conflict (monsters are
too busy attacking each other to worry about or even approach the player), and
so make conflict overall not quite as powerful for trivializing tough areas of
the game like the Sanctum and Astral.
