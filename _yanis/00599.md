You can engrave on walls or doors. Elbereth doesn't work unless you're standing on it. You can read it by standing on the nearest space. Random graffiti, if it generates on a floor square next to a wall or door, may say "Something is written on the wall here." instead of the floor. Graffiti could render as ~ or something similar.
