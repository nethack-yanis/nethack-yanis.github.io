You can engrave on walls or doors. Elbereth on walls or doors doesn't work. You can read it by standing on the nearest space. Random graffiti, if it generates on a floor square next to a wall or door, may say "Something is written on the wall here." instead of the floor. Graffiti could render as ~ or something similar.
