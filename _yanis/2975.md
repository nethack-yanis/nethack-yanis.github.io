New artifact, *The Dwarf Bread*, or possibly, *The Battle Bread of B'hrian Bloodaxe*. It is a cram ration, and if the object materials patch is present it is made of stone. It cannot be eaten; if you try you get a YAFM about how you really aren't *that* hungry. Its main effect is that while carried with no other apparent food available, your nutrition will not decrease if it is at or below the threshold of going from Hungry to Weak.

You are considered to "have food available" if:
* You are carrying any food in your inventory or in containers.
* There is any comestible, anything at all, that you can see on the map.

Possibly, it acts as a club when wielded, though being a cram ration it can't be enchanted.
