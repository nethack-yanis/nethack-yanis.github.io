Implement antimagic fields as a region. They are a static, possibly invisible
region inside which magical effects cannot function, including all of the
following effects:
* Completely disables spellcasting both for the player and for monsters.
* Monsters behave as if cancelled, as do you if you are polymorphed.
* Enchantments do not add to AC or weapon to-hit or damage.
* Magical extrinsics are suppressed.
* Potions have no magic effects (so non-magic potions like acid work the same,
  but e.g. drinking a potion of object detection would consume the potion and do
  nothing else).
* Scrolls do nothing; they won't disintegrate when read but won't do anything
  else either. "You pronounce the formula, but nothing happens."
* Wands do nothing; they won't consume a charge when zapped or engraved with,
  and can only engrave in the dust.
* Artifacts have no special powers.

The anti-magic field trap could be repurposed into casting one of these rather
than draining energy, which could be split off into a different trap type.
