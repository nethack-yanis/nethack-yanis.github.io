All sinks spawn with a ring buried beneath them. If you kick the sink and get the "Flupp! Muddy water" message, the sink will spit out one of the rings buried under it. This removes the need for the S_LRING flag, and also allows players a non-destructive way to retrieve rings they dropped down the sink.
