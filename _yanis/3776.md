Speed boots can give you additional movement points equal to their enchantment.
There are a couple non-mutually-exclusive options for doing this:
* This only works for blessed speed boots.
* If the enchantment is negative, they subtract movement points, to a minimum of
  1.
* To avoid the amount of movement points  being predictable, the number of bonus
  movement points is slightly fuzzed by adding a random number from -1 to +1
  each time it's applied.
* The boots do not themselves provide any bonus movement, or provide a smaller
  one than they do now. The bonus from enchantment makes up the bulk of it.
