Bows should be two-handed, as they require both hands to use properly. You're already not allowed to twoweapon with them, but it shouldn't really be possible to wear a shield and fire a bow at the same time either, except maybe a small shield. Possibly classify them as hand-and-a-half weapons, in variants that have those, or just disallow firing with a bow while wearing a shield.
