Remove or greatly reduce the chance of monsters to get a wand of teleportation,
on the basis that the vast majority of the zaps that monsters are given with
these wands end up in the player's hands, allowing them to bring a pile of them
to the Astral Plane and use them to make that level significantly easier. If
they do not generate in monster inventories, a full game might see about 3 or 4
wands appear on average.
