Mummy traps, a new trap type that generates with a very desirable item: highly
enchanted gear, magic markers, items with object properties, etc. However, when
you pick it up or interact with it in any way like teleporting it or having a
pet collect it, a bunch of mummies appear around you (they would obviously need
to be more threatening than they are right now). Also can have a "mummy room", a
special room that contains one mummy trap and nothing else.
