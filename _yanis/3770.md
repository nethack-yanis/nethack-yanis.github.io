In the context of restoring the tension and strategizing created by encountering
a mind flayer, which used to be a lot higher when their amnesia caused
forgetting maps and discoveries:

The psychic blast of a mind flayer may make you hallucinate, to create
short-term tension, and possibly create long-term strategic tension by counting
as Intelligence abuse.

However, since mind blasts are a lot less avoidable and harder to strategize
around than getting into melee with a mind flayer, it may be better to add
these as additional things they can do in melee (but probably not Intelligence
abuse, since they already directly drain Intelligence points).
