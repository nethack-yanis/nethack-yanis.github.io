If cast at Skilled or above, the spell of force bolt knocks back the first
monster it hits (probably only 1 square like a monk's staggering blow, or
perhaps an Expert cast could provide additional knockback).

Wands of striking would not change since the Basic effects of the spell do not
change.

Note that only two roles can cast force bolt at these levels: Knights (at
Skilled) and Wizards (at Expert).
