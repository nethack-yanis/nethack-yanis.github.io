You can invoke a ring of hunger to make yourself more hungry immediately so you can eat dragon or giant corpses. (You have to be wearing it and have it identified.)

Maybe rather than having all rings of hunger capable of doing this, have it be a single artifact ring of hunger. Suggested names for this artifact include Overeater, Bottomless Pit, Cookie Monster, Glutton, and The Hungering.
