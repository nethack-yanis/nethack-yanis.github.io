You should be able to invoke a worn, identified ring of hunger to make yourself
more hungry immediately so you can eat dragon or giant corpses.

Maybe rather than having all rings of hunger capable of doing this, have it be a
single artifact ring of hunger. Suggested names for this artifact include
Overeater, Bottomless Pit, Cookie Monster, Glutton, and The Hungering.
