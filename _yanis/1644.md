Bookworm, a <span class="nhsym clr-brightblue">w</span> monster that eats books (they end up in its stomach/inventory and aren't destroyed, though they may lose a read charge). Levels up, gaining power and speed, for each book it eats (higher level books give it more power), eventually gaining more attacks. Possibly can also eat scrolls. Initializes as having already eaten a few books.
