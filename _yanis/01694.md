Dragons' alignments are adjusted so that the values actually matter (at the least, yellow should be very lawful, gray should be pure neutral, and black should be very chaotic), and are not specified as M2_HOSTILE anymore so that they can rarely be generated peaceful. Perhaps more interestingly, their difficulties should be varied.
