Throwing holy water at demons should be buffed way over its current 2d6 damage,
because it's a fun interaction. Instead, it should severely weaken them, cancel
them, stun them, and/or do a large amount of damage (perhaps 50% or some
proportion of their max HP, possibly exempted for demon lords whose fights it
would trivialize).
