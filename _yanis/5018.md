A spellcasting buff system for Wizards, in which learning a new spell grants you
a point on a metamagic skill tree. Most options available on this tree provide
incremental buffs to spells you cast with each point invested, with a maximum of
5 points. There are also capstone buffs that are binary.

The exact shape of the tree is not determined, but a list of potential
incremental buffs is:
- More damage.
- More explosions.
- Increased ray or beam range.
- Reduced Pw cost of casting.
- Bonus movement points when you cast any spell.
- Temporary bonus to AC when you cast any spell.
- Temporary to-hit or weapon damage bonus when you cast any spell.
- Suffocating magic; shut down dissimilar magic to the spell that you just cast
  for a few turns.

Possible capstone buffs include:
- You can smite-target spells without needing to see the space.
- Elemental casting that substitutes the damage types of certain ray and
  explosion spells.
