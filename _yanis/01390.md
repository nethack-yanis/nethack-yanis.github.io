If you dip for Excalibur while using a helm of opposite alignment to be lawful and the attempt would succeed, the Lady of the Lake notices that something is wrong. She emerges from the fountain, grabs your sword, turns it into Excalibur, and rips off your helmet. This allows non-lawfuls to get Excalibur, but only by defeating her.
