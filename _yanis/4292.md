Knights who have never consorted with a foocubus have a permanent +1 intrinsic
increase damage bonus, which they lose when they do consort with one, with the
goal of it being something that is not a huge difference to lose, but does add
up over the long run, and which will not stop pacifist knights from using
foocubi to achieve the Quest level. This is based on Lancelot and Galahad in
Arthurian legend.
