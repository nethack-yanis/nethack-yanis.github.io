Artifact ring that provides a cocktail of basic resistances all at once (fire,
cold, shock, poison, maybe sleep, maybe acid). This is interesting primarily
because it is very useful early in the game and then becomes progressively less
useful later on as the hero gets intrinsic resistances.

Could be named "The Ring of Everything Resistance" or "The Chromatic Ring".
