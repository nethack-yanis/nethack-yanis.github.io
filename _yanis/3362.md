Make the sparkle animation not necessarily synchronous with its related
messages. Instead, when the core game engine calls the sparkle function, it
informs the windowport that it should display a sparkle, and then proceeds as
normal. The windowport may decide to play them immediately (as is currently
enforced) or it may decide to defer playing any sparkles until just before the
next time the player is prompted for input.

The primary use case for this is with multi-line windowports such as the curses
interface, in which one might be on the Plane of Fire and get several messages
like "foo stepped on a fire trap but is unharmed", each with its own sparkle.
Under the current system, the game must wait until each sparkle is finished
before printing the next message. This implementation would allow the game to
print all the messages at once, and then display all the sparkles one by one, or
even simultaneously if it wants to.
