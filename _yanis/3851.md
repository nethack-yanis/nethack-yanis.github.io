Remove the scroll and spellbook of identify, and in place of them add in items
that work like a touchstone: each such item is useful at identifying the type of
items of a particular object class, like touchstones are for gems. Also like
touchstones, certain roles and races have affinities or advantages with various
of these identifier items.
