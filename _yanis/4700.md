If you have a melee combat buff that causes a visual effect, such as from a
confuse monster effect (or other ones in variants, such as the burning hands
spell) it should be readily visible in either the #seeweapon (`)`) command if
you are non-blind as e.g. "a - a dagger (weapon in hand). Your hands are glowing
red." or in the #attributes (ctrl-x) command as e.g. "You are able to confuse
monsters that you hit.", or both. Possibly, if implementing both, the effect
should not be provided in #attributes, but only in feedback from enlightenment.
