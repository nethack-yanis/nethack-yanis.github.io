Quest artifacts, and probably all artifacts, blast other monsters when they enter their inventory, subject to the same checks and chances as the player (however, the artifact will never evade their grasp). This is most likely to be observed when a quest nemesis or the Wizard of Yendor steals a quest artifact from the player.
