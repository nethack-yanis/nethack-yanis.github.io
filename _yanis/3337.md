Evil librarian monster: it is peaceful at first, but considers every spell you
know to be an overdue library book, and charges you a $100 late fee per book
when it encounters you. If you don't pay, it attacks. Possibly they carry some
books, and if you manage to keep it peaceful, you can loan books from it. May
generate with a magic marker.
