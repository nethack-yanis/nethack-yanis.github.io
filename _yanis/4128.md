Add a potion of milk, working along the same lines as milk in Minecraft, which
cancels potion effects (or since not many potions have lasting effects that
you'd want to cancel, it cancels various temporary good and bad status effects
in general, like confusion, stunning, and invisibility, but not nausea since
drinking milk usually makes nausea worse in real life.
