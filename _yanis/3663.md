Any item can be dipped into a potion of levitation to permanently reduce its
weight by 20%. This uses up the potion, and it will only affect the item's base
weight, not the weight of any contents (i.e. a bag of holding thus dipped will
weigh 12 + contents instead of 15 + contents). If the object is canceled at a
later point, it loses this property and reverts to its normal weight.

The effect cannot be stacked; attempting to dip an already-levitated object into
another levitation potion will have no effect and will not use up the potion.

A possible variation is to also confer this effect for potions of enlightenment,
since "enlightening" the item could be interpreted as making it physically
lighter.
