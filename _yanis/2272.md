Sokoban is a one-level branch that strings together a bunch of different puzzles
that must each be defeated in turn, all eventually leading to the treasure zoo.
Obviously, the pits must be changed to holes that drop you on the level with the
Sokoban stairs.

This allows the player to use object detection to see what the prize is ahead of
time, and therefore whether they want to bother doing the puzzles or not.
