New artifact spellbook ''Akashic Records'':
* Read for enlightenment
* Can be applied like a stethoscope to probe adjacent enemies, doesn't cost a turn
* When carried, gives extrinsic monster detection. Farlooking reveals enemy HP.
* Invoke for precognition: for the next 100 turns, your attacks never miss, and enemies roll twice against you and use the lower result.
* If you would be killed from HP damage from an attack during precognition, you will dodge the killing blow and all subsequent attacks on that round. Immediately ends the effect.
* Might mesh well with the other encyclopedia idea, using it as a base item type.
