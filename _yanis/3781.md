New command, #use. It is undocumented and hidden in the list of commands so that
only experienced players or source divers will know about it. It translates into
the typical command an experienced player would situationally use. E.g. on a
throne with no items it turns into #sit, on a box it does #loot, on an altar it
turns into #offer.
