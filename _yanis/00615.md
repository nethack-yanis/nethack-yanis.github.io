Nazgul cannot be killed "incorrectly" (unclear on what this needs to be, perhaps stabbing them with a barrow-wight's knife, or being female). If you happen to kill one incorrectly, it will be killed without giving experience and its inventory will be deleted (minus unique items). The Nazgul born counter then ticks down by one, so it can be spawned again elsewhere by the normal mechanism.
