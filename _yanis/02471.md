The player can shove things, dealing no damage but pushing the monster back. The monster can resist and fail to be shoved; it will resist harder if the terrain opposite it is hostile. You can only shove if you have hands, and you cannot do it to small or tiny monsters. Possibly an AT_SHOV attack should also be introduced for monsters to shove the player.
