Rather than the replacement for techniques being certain roles learning new spells
from nowhere once you achieve a certain experience level, have the spells be
known from the beginning, but uncastable unless you are above that level.

This also helps disincentivize drain-for-gain tactics, since keeping yourself
at a lower level will cut off your access to certain spells.
