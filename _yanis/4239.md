Telepathy currently sees things with minds. Change it (or perhaps change only
the amulet of ESP, leaving other telepathy the same) so that it sees things with
*souls* instead of minds. Mostly this corresponds with the same monsters (with a
few exceptions such as mummies which are animated by the soul of the dead
person), but if a monster with a soul is polymorphed into a form that normally
doesn't, it retains its original soul, and shows up as its original form to ESP.

Additionally, ESP shows the spirit of a humanoid with a soul just after you
kill it if you're blind, making some angry or resigned gestures before fading
away.
