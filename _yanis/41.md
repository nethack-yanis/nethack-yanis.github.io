Players can polymorph dungeon features by zapping a polymorph beam down at it, with some special cases:
* Gravestones can be created by polymorph and are more likely than other outcomes, but cannot be polymorphed into anything else. Trying to do so only polymorphs its epitaph.
* Polymorphing an altar angers that altar's god and any attendant priest since you effectively destroyed their altar
* Fountains either cannot polymorph into anything besides headstones or have a very limited chance of becoming something else; this is to prevent the player from being able to generate a bunch of thrones from fountains.
