When an egg gets very, very old, it cracks and releases a small stinking cloud. If it happens to be carried by the player, the cloud centers on the player. When it is within 100 turns of cracking (or perhaps just after it's gone rotten), the player can throw it and it will release the stinking cloud wherever it shatters.
