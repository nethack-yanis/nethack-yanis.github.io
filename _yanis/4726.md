Gods should use a wider array of solutions to fixing troubles. For instance, a
god might give you a pile of corpses or food items that respect conducts you
have kept rather than magically filling your stomach.

An ideal implementation would respect the gods' personalities - e.g. if you're
low on HP and facing a lot of monsters, a "war god" could blast everything near
you (but not you) with wide angle disintegration beams, while a "peace god"
might pacify everything near you.
