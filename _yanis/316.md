Alter the scroll of remove curse's effects:
* An uncursed scroll does the same thing as a blessed scroll does now, uncursing
  everything in your inventory.
* A blessed scroll uncurses everything in your inventory and then blesses a few
  items.
* A cursed scroll randomly curses inventory as the curse items spell would do.

May need to make this scroll rarer or more expensive to write in order to keep
it balanced.
