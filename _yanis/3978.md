Pits get deeper the further down in the dungeon you are, which makes them deal
more damage, might cause wounded legs with a chance that increases with depth,
and take longer to escape from (or are so deep you can't climb out at all). In
Gehennom, they might deal extra damage on account of being designed and put
there by demons. The extra depth could be conveyed to the player by "You fall
into a [very] deep pit!"
