Add a themed room that contains an engraving explaining a random one of the
game's predefined alchemy recipes, and possibly one of the potion ingredients.
The idea of this is to provide unspoiled players (or spoiled players who are out
of date on alchemy changes) with an in-game means of learning the recipes.
