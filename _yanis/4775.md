[Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) as an alternate puzzle
branch or Sokoban replacement. This consists of a map area where items are to be
placed, and burned engravings in the rows and columns to the top and left
specifying the amounts of rocks to place in contiguous blobs in that row or
column. There is a "stock" of some low-value item (probably rocks) that can be
placed in the spots, but the puzzle will accept any item dropped on the floor.

Whenever an item is dropped or picked up from the floor, the game checks the
presence or absence of an item on the floor in each square of the nonogram map,
and considers the puzzle solved if the number of squares containing any amount
of objects in each contiguous blob in each row and column matches its
specifications.

The puzzles could be drawn from a set of stock specified puzzles, or completely
randomized.
