Add another variable to the eshk shopkeeper struct, which tracks how much they dislike you. If you break their door or rob them, they'll continue to dislike you even after you compensate them. A shopkeeper who dislikes you strongly will inflate their prices. It may be possible to get them to stop disliking you by buying lots of things from them, but probably not.
