Mines' End variant that is an actual mine, with many twisty corridors dug out of the rock, and many unmined gems in the rock. The luckstone is unmined, in one of several possible spaces, not adjacent to any corridors but not too far away from them, and certainly not as far away as in the Wine Cellar. A pickaxe will be guaranteed somewhere on this level.
