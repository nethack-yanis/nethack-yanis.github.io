More harassment effects: the chance of respawning the Wizard is a fixed 1/7 and the rest of the effects are equal probability. Multiple non-duplicate effects may happen at the same time.
* Unchanged: curse items, summon nasties, vaguely nervous, aggravate monsters
* Darken much of the level, and extinguish, destroy, or cut the remaining
  lifetime of light sources. Maybe also blind the player.
* Drop boulders around the upstairs, or iron bars.
* Spawn pools centered on the player, with sea monsters in them.
* Spawn lava around the level, not under the player.
* Create a hole or pit under the player.
* Create a stinking cloud centered on the player.
* If you are carrying the Amulet, it teleports to a random square on your level or the level below.
* If you are carrying the Amulet, it (and possibly any fake Amulets) becomes heavier. This either lasts until the next harassment triggers, or is permanent but the total amount of weight added to the amulet has some sort of cap on it. This is interesting primarily because it targets carry cap, which is a valuable end-game resource.
* A variety of powerful player debuffs such as dealing half damage, taking double damage, blocking HP or Pw regeneration, super hunger, etc.
