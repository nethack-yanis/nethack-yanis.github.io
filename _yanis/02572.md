Assuming an implementation in which Gehennom starts to get destroyed after you remove the Amulet: When you kill the high priest of Moloch, he gives you a multiline death message calling you a fool and saying you don't know what you have done, and maybe hinting a little bit at why Hell is about to go to hell.
