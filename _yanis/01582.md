Excalibur starts out much weaker than it currently does, but you can perform further feats to enhance its power and give it more abilities as the game progresses. Such feats include: slaying a dragon, returning to King Arthur having finished the Quest, getting crowned as a lawful, re-dipping it into a fountain at a high experience level.
