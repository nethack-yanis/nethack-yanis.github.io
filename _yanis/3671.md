Greasy floor, a new type of terrain (or perhaps a trap?) that applies grease to
any boots you are wearing and almost always makes you slip. Slipping on greasy
floor (which can also happen by walking barefoot or with already-greased boots
on) causes you to drop random items, some of which may get greased.
