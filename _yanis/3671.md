Greasy floor, a new type of terrain (or perhaps a trap?) that applies grease to
any boots you are wearing and almost always makes you slip. Slipping on greasy
floor (which can also happen by walking barefoot or with already-greased boots
on) causes you to drop random items, some of which may get greased.

The player can create greasy floor by smashing a potion of oil or applying
(multiple?) charges from a can of grease to the floor.

Creatures that move onto a greasy floor patch may "slip and slide and struggle to
stay upright", losing their next turn 70% of the time. This also happens to a
creature standing on a greasy floor patch that tries to do something involving
footwork (combat, moving off the square, etc) 30% of the time. Or for a more
simplified implementation, the trap doesn't have to cause loss of turn when
moved onto (though it might still produce a message), but has a 70% chance of
making the creature lose its next turn *regardless* of the action (still need to
keep your balance to take out a scroll to read or zap a wand, for instance).

If implemented as a trap, it cannot be untrapped (except probably by the
standard method of digging a pit on it), but will eventually wear out after a
slightly randomized number of times it affects something. (This prevents you
from setting a single one in Ludios and then standing back to watch the whole
army get greased and fall over themselves.)
