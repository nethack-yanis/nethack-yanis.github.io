Searching finds everything in your range, but is an occupation that takes multiple turns. The s command by default will take some constant number of turns (somewhere from 10-20) and will either tell you about all the hidden things around you or tell you that there is nothing interesting; you can specify a numeric prefix to search for less than that if you want.
