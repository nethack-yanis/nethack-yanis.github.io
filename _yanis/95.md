Searching should find everything immediately adjacent to you, but is an
occupation that takes multiple turns. The s command by default takes some
constant number of turns (somewhere from 10-20) and will either tell you about
all the hidden things around you or tell you that there is nothing interesting;
you can specify a numeric prefix to search for less than that if you want.
