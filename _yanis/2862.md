Cut down on the list of inediate monsters by defining some of them to be either herbivorous or carnivorous (note that the game uses carnivorous to mean "can eat meat" rather than "only eats meat").

Herbivores:
* Killer bee and queen bee
* All types of nymph

Carnivores:
* Salamanders
* Kops
* Imps, homunculi, tengu, and leprechaun
