Wearing gauntlets of dexterity allows you to quick-draw a wand (zapping any wand
in your inventory as a half action, similar to applying a stethoscope - it costs
no time but can only be done once per action).

Also, they allow you to use a container in inventory as a half action. For
balance, you should probably only be able to do one half-action thing per turn.
