The Longbow of Diana has different effects based on which alignment you are (or perhaps it's just different artifact bows, only one of which appears). Lawfuls get an Apollonian bow which shoots gold arrows which have higher base damage. Neutrals' bow fires silver regular arrows. Chaotics' bow automatically poisons fired arrows.
