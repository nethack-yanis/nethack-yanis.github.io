Assuming [dtsund's dragon scale mail proposal](http://roguelikes.live/nh4-bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=629) has been implemented: Confer extra dragon scale extrinsics (similar to those found in FIQHack: speed for blue scales, free action for orange scales, etc) if and only if the player is wearing dragon-scaled armor and a matching set of scales in their cloak slot.
