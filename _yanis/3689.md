Add 1-tile-wide corridors linking the rooms that contain the temples together in
the Astral Plane, likely with secret doors so that monsters don't start going
through them. These give the player the ability to get around the Riders and go
from the wrong temple to the correct one faster, but you run the risk of getting
bogged down and surrounded if you use them.

It was pointed out that 1-tile-wide corridors may actually make things much
easier on the player and would offer a much safer point to retreat to. Ideally
they should be designed without long straight areas so the player can't easily
remove a bunch of monsters with a few well-placed teleportation zaps, but also
be widened to avert the problem of being a refuge.
