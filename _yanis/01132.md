Italchiayaque can be read to get a clairvoyance mapping, with the message "You see nearby terrain reflected in the depths of the shield." This should possibly be limited so that it can't be done infinitely; perhaps it only works when the invoke timeout is zero and increases the invoke timeout by some small amount when read.
