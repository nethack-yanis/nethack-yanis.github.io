In variants with object materials: replace the shield of reflection with a "polished shield", which is nonmagical. It can come in any material, but only brass, copper, silver, and gold are shiny enough to make it also confer reflection. (That is, you can have a polished wooden shield or a polished iron shield, but the material just isn't lustrous enough.)
