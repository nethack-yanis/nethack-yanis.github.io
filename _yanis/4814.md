Since EvilHack has lava gremlins and regular "water" gremlins, it should also
have earth gremlins and air gremlins. Earth gremlins steal intrinsics at night,
can phase through rock and eat gold, and split when they eat gold. Air gremlins
are permanently displaced, like displacer beasts, and steal intrinsics during
the day (it's not specified what would prompt them to split).
