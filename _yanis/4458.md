When the player is on a water space, track whether they are submerged or
swimming on top of the water. By default, entering water without the risk of
drowning still puts you at the bottom, but you can use < to ascend to the top.

A primary effect of this is to establish consistency with what you can and can't
interact with while in water - it doesn't make much sense that monsters standing
on an adjacent land square, or monsters flying on an adjacent water square, can
hit you in melee when you're underwater, nor the other way around. If being on
top or bottom of the water is tracked, these cases can be prevented, but care
would have to be taken so that the hero can't dive underwater and be completely
safe and able to recover with impunity.

One possible mitigation (in addition to blocking an underwater hero from
using melee attacks on adjacent monsters that aren't in the water themselves)
would be to make monsters that can't currently attack the swimming hero avoid
getting into melee range. Though this still wouldn't deal with zapping them with
spells from a safe distance.
