An Infidel not carrying the Amulet can still cast spells (in contrast to the
current setup where they cannot), but instead of casting the spells with Pw,
they use blood magic and use HP instead. It doesn't necessarily cost as much HP
as it would Pw - there can be a scaling factor.

If trying to cast a spell that would cost more Pw than the hero has current HP,
they die.
