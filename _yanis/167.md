You should be able to invoke the Amulet of Yendor exactly once for a wish, with
some unspecified major drawbacks.

Following the 3.7.0 change where touching the Amulet of Yendor for the first
time grants a wish with no drawbacks, it has also been proposed that it should
require invoking the Amulet instead, but only after it has been fully
identified.
