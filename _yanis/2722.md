Fog horn, a magical tool that when played surrounds the user with clouds and
possibly fog clouds (the monster).

It would be best if some type of non-poison-gas cloud were implemented first; it
is probably a bad idea to actually change the terrain around the user into
cloud. It would also be good if the obscuring cloud were useful at blocking
monsters' pathing to the player; currently they would ignore it so creating a
fog cloud would mostly hinder the player.
