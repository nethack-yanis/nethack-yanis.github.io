Nerf the spell of charm monster heavily. It never tames a hostile monster directly. If it would have succeeded, it only pacifies the monster. Peaceful monsters can be tamed on subsequent casts, but trying and failing to tame a peaceful intelligent monster may anger it. Pacifying a hostile monster is dependent on monster MR, while taming a peaceful monster is dependent on the relative levels of the player and the monster. The scroll of taming should be more powerful and reliable than the spell.
