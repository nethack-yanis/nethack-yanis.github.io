Split Gehennom into two different branches - Hell, which contains devils and the
lawful "demon" lords like Asmodeus, and the Abyss, which contains demons and the
chaotic demon lords. Either only one of these generates in a given game, or the
player gets a choice of which one to go to in the Valley of the Dead.
Alternatively, they're sequential parts of Gehennom, with the Abyss being
deeper.
