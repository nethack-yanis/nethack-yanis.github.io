New type of terrain, "fire terrain", a square that is on fire. It displays as an
orange period. (If this will be too nasty to people who play with color off, the
glyph should perhaps be changed.)
* Fire terrain has a certain amount of burning wood material on it.
* Standing next to or on fire terrain grants cold resistance, but standing on
  top of fire terrain has the same effect as a fire trap whenever you end your
  turn on it.
* The fire eventually burns out and reverts to normal floor, the duration
  determined by the total weight of the burning objects.
* Killing a wood golem with fire or burning more than a certain weight of
  objects on a square creates fire terrain on that space.
* Throwing burnables onto a fire trap may make them spontaneously combust and
  produce fire terrain.
* Fire terrain can be used to cook corpses.
* You can create fire terrain by applying a lit candle to a space with burnables
  on it
* You can also create it by applying a tinderbox to a space, which is a
  chargeable non-magical tool. Archeologists and Rangers start with one.
* Fires provide a light source of radius 3, but cannot be moved.
* Monster AI will not travel over fire if the monster is not resistant.
