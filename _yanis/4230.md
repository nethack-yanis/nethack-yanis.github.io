2% of the time after getting the "Blecch! Rotten food!" message as a Tourist,
you get one of the following YAFMs:
* "This is not as the travel agency described it!"
* "The native cuisine is not entirely to your liking."
* "Definitely authentic native cuisine."
* "Ugh!  The local food explains the dispositions of the locals."
* "This must be that 'hate cuisine' you read about."
* "Where's the garlic and steaks you heard about?"
