A monster passive ability (possibly for shambling horrors or beholders) that
unmaps its surrounding. This would be most useful when the monster also has
something that incentivizes blinding yourself when near it, such as gaze
attacks.

However, this can be negated by player note-taking of the map before the monster
wipes it, so care should be taken not to make that worth doing.
