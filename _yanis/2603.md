If both of your hands are occupied, you cannot multishoot thrown ammo (e.g. darts, shuriken, daggers). You can still multishoot if you're firing ammo from a launcher.

Multishot cap is halved if you are wielding something in your main hand other than the requisite launcher for what you're trying to multishoot, regardless of if your other hand is free.
