Reading a spellbook while confused may teach you a random spell but only set your memory of it to 1000 turns. It can also reduce memory of all other spells by 1000. Alternatively, it has no real effect, and just prints a message "You were holding the spellbook upside down... You learn the spell of 'kcol draziw'." (a random spell name printed backwards).
