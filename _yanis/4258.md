Track all alignment violations according to their source, which means when you
anger a peaceful you tick up an "angered a peaceful" counter, when you rob a
grave you increment "grave robbed", etc. Enough incrementing in any counter
(which may vary based on your role and alignment) starts to make your god angry
and priests unfriendly. The idea is that if you have a large number of alignment
violations but they're spread out across multiple causes, you might skate by,
but repeatedly and happily doing a bad thing will get you punished (and will
allow your god to actually vocalize what you've been doing wrong). It would
also be nice to show in the dumplog what your worst sins were.
