It should be possible to define anti-spawn regions in a level, like how monsters
will not generate in the Sokoban hole corridors but more general. It should
still be possible for monsters to appear in specific places within such regions
that are specified in the level definition, but monsters specified to appear in
random places won't, nor will any monster that generates after the level is
created. This could be done by checking the anti-spawn regions in the
makemon_rnd_goodpos function.
