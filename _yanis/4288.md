Allow for gas clouds of different types (confusion gas, sleep gas, hallucination
gas, etc) by passing an additional argument to create\_gas\_cloud.

Clouds of sleep gas would immediately have a use in Nazgul and orange dragon
breath attacks, which are already described as such. They might also be useful
for sleeping gas traps, which would emit an actual cloud of sleep gas. Depending
on implementation, the sleep gas cloud could have only a chance of inducing
sleep rather than always knocking you out, which could make it tactically
interesting to navigate/teleport/etc rather than just getting put to sleep and
having the cloud gone by the time you wake up.

Potions that boil or shatter (but not freeze) should release a cloud of gas that
causes the potion's vapor effects to creatures caught in the cloud, replacing
the existing system where vapor effects can happen at an unclear distance from
the site of the potion.
