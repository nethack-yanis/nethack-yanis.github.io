Since Barbarians are thematically supposed to be wary of magic use, they should
get an alignment penalty whenever they use magic. This could just be for casting
spells, or it could be made harder (but more relevant since Barbarians tend to
do very little spellcasting anyway) by also assessing the penalty when using
obviously magic items like wands or scrolls.
