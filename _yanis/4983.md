Vary the list of prayer boons by alignment. For instance:
- Lawfuls can get a boon that makes them a light source for a fairly long time.
- Chaotics can get nasty poison on all their weapons, even melee ones.

This list is very incomplete. Another idea is to vary the list of boons
according to the individual gods and their mythologies, but that would require
an even bigger list of boons.
