If you specify a wish that has 2 contradicting terms, "rustproof"/"fixed" etc
alongside a specific object type that doesn't suffer from erosion, there should
be a chance that the wish parser resolves the contradiction by respecting the
erodeproof part and not the object type part, so you end up getting an
erodable but erodeproof object that wasn't the type you asked for.
