Put an attended temple to Moloch in the Orc Temple Mines' End, and guarantee generation of the Orc Temple if Minetown has already been generated and is Orcish Town, so that an aligned priest always exists (unless the player's unlucky enough to generate a non-Orc Temple Mines' End prior to generating Minetown, and then visits Minetown and gets Orcish Town).

Instead of a human priest of Moloch, it might be possible to have one of the orc shamans generate with an epri struct attached, so it tends the altar like a normal priest.
