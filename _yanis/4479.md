If you die to a bag of tricks ("carnivorous bag") and produce a bones file,
neither your ghost nor any of your possessions will appear in the file... just
the bag on the floor. Someone who subsequently finds and applies the bag will
cause a hostile player monster with all the "dead" player's gear to pop out of
it.
