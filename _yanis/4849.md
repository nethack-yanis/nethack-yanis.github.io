Gulthias trees should have an attack that starts a timer where you gradually
turn into a blight, which ends the game if you succumb to it (without life
saving, at least) since you have been converted, similar to how turning to slime
works. Also similar to sliming, if you become a blight, you should be one in any
bones file that gets created.
