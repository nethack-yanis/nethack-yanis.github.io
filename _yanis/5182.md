A bag of traps, a chargeable magic tool which creates a random trap on your
space. Alternatively, have it be a wand of trap creation, which would be
nondirectional.

There could be some way to force creation of a specific trap, perhaps by
wielding a component which gets consumed, such as arrows for an arrow trap, or a
potion of water for a rust trap.
