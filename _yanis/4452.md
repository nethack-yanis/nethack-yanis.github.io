Barbed devils have a passive physical attack that involves you getting pierced
by their barbs. Possibly if you are wearing body armor and/or gloves, or
wielding a two-handed weapon with longer reach, the passive attack may not
always hit you. (Polearms should never incur this attack, but the way passive
attacks work by default should already ensure this.)
