In variants with percentage intrinsics, intrinsics granted by one's role need
not be binary. For instance, monks tend to gain a lot of elemental resistances
by leveling up, so rather than having those be all-or-nothing cutoffs at fixed
levels, spread it out so that they gain a decent percentage of the resistance
with each level near the original cutoff.

This would complicate the enlightenment display, since now it would have to
disclose something like "You have 76% fire resistance: 45% from corpses and 31%
from your priest levels".
