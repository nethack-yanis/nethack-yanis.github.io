Red light, a <span class="nhsym clr-red">y</span> that has an explosion attack
that causes paralysis. This is a reference to red lights in real life making you
stop.

(There could also be green lights whose explosion gives a temporary speed boost,
but since this isn't harmful to the target it's a sillier idea.)
