Red light, a <span class="nhsym clr-red">y</span> that has an explosion attack
that causes paralysis. This is a reference to red (traffic) lights in real life
making you stop.

(There could also be green lights whose explosion gives a temporary speed boost,
and yellow lights' explosion could be expanded to slow the target as well as
blinding it, but since this isn't harmful to the target it's a sillier idea.)
