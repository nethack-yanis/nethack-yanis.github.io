Warning levels for monsters should be revised, because there are many low-level
but seriously threatening monsters in EvilHack, and at the same time there are
many mid-level monsters which can only deal physical HP damage and have nothing
particularly special about them, so they are not particularly threatening.

Possibly, the warning score should be moved into a manually-assigned constant in
the species definition, rather than being calculated.
