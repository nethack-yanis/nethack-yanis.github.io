When a silver item would randomly generate within Gehennom, try to reroll its materials (possibly multiple times) so that it's less likely to be silver. This is because the inhabitants of Gehennom would likely have tried to get rid of all the local silver. Additionally, demons should never receive silver items in their starting inventory.
