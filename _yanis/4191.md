Angering peaceful monsters by casting an innocuous spell like light is very
annoying, so split the spell up into a "light area" spell, which does not damage
anything unless it's a highly light-sensitive monster like a gremlin, and a
"light blast" or "flash" attack spell, which may or may not light the area
permanently and is designed to blind monsters.
