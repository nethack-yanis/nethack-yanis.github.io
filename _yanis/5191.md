Hermit: an always-generated-peaceful, sessile human monster. Possibly only one
can generate per game. He or she collects books and will ask for books when
chatted to. In exchange for each book, they dispense a rumor which is false if
the book was cursed and true otherwise.

A more complicated extension is that rather than simply taking the books, they
could instead stash them into a magic-chest-like extradimensional space, the
contents of which show up in an identical chest in the Wizard's Tower. The
significance of this is left up to the player's interpretation.
