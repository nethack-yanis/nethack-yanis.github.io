Spell staves should remove a much greater share of armor penalties for spells of
their associated school than they currently do.

Another possible bonus they could have to make them more worthwhile is to treat
any spell of their associated school as cast at one higher skill level than your
current skill in it (does nothing if you are already Expert, since defining
Master effects for spells is likely out of scope).
