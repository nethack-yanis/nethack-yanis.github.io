When faced with a pickup_burden prompt ("You have a little trouble
lifting/removing a foo. Continue?") deliberately ignore space, forcing the user
to enter y, n or q. These prompts commonly come when removing a lot of items
from a bag or picking up many items, and the player is spacing through all of
them.
