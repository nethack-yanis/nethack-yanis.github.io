Getting lifesaved should have permanent detrimental effects. Perhaps it reduces
your maximum, as well as current, Wis or Con (Con is preferred, because it
impacts both carrying capacity and regeneration), and if the ability score it
would reduce is 3 or below, life saving does not work at all. It could also
possibly drain 1d3+1 levels.
