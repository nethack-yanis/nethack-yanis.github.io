Getting lifesaved should have permanent detrimental effects. Perhaps it reduces
the stat maximum for an attribute as well as the attribute's current value, like
Wis or Con (Con is preferred, because it hits both carrying capacity and
regeneration), and if the attribute it would reduce is 3 or below, life saving
does not work at all. It could also possibly drain 1d3+1 levels.
