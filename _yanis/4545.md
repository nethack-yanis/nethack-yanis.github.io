Zapping a wand of polymorph at Master skill gives you control over the
form the target monsters polymorph into, whether that is yourself or others.
Other monsters still get their chance to resist the polymorph entirely.

It would not give you control over what an object would polymorph into, for
obvious reasons.

However, if there are monsters that can use the wand of polymorph at master
skill, this has the potential to become very annoying very fast, since they
would be able to turn the player into a sessile monster, make them break their
armor, or turn themselves into something very threatening and out of depth.
