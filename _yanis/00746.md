If you have divine protection and become near death from a timed instadeath or low HP, some or all of your protection may automatically convert itself into a cure: "You suddenly feel the power of [deity] surround you! You feel limber/cured/much better/etc." This should probably work for a narrow range of symptoms (probably not HP loss, possibly any major trouble). It should also probably not work in Gehennom.
