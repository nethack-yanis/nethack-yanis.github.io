Iron doors should be able to take water damage and become rusty. Once rusty, it
should be possible to break an iron door like a normal wooden one.

Alternatively, iron doors should be corrodable by throwing or smashing acid on
them, with it taking 2-3 potions to weaken a door to the point of
destroyability.
