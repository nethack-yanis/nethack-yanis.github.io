Silence auras that prevent both you and monsters spellcasting. Maybe also a directed silence spell, which silences an individual monster. While silenced, monsters can't be chatted to, and nothing they do will make noise (possibly only if in a silence aura).

While under the effect of silence, the player's stealth is elevated.
