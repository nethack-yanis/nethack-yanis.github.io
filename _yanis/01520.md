To make zombies more bearable than giving you immediate deathly illness or brain drain, do it like D&amp;D where they need to grapple you before biting you. Do this by giving them a sticky grab attack, and ignoring the existence of their bite attack if they aren't already grappled on to you (or you are being grappled by another zombie). For this matter, this should probably also work this way for mind flayers, which also need to grapple you successfully in D&D.
