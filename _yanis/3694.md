A reduced version of the Wands Balance Patch in which there is still a new
wand-use skill, but not varying wand effects at different levels of skill
(because the skill of the wielder shouldn't affect the magic in the wand).
Instead, increased wand skill gives you higher accuracy (no more/much less
missing Rodney with a death ray, for instance) and perhaps other perks such as
being able to zap a wand once per turn as a bonus action, as with a stethoscope.
