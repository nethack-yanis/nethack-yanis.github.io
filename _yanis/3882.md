Items generated in or sold to shops are marked as being property of that shop,
and when you buy it properly, this marking is cleared. When you attempt to sell
an item to a shop that is currently marked as the shop's property (meaning it
was not properly paid for), the shopkeeper just confiscates it without paying.
This prevents you from directly or indirectly stealing the same item over and
over again and getting paid for it every time.
