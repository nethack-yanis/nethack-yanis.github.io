Ring of criticality, a charged ring that has an (enchantment)% chance per hit of changing the result of the die roll for that hit into a critical hit that deals double damage (and will trigger effects such as Vorpal Blade decapitation). If negatively enchanted, it has the same chance of changing the die roll into a critical failure that deals zero or 1 damage.
