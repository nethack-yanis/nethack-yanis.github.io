Lightning spells:
* Lightning bolt can be a melee range spell that deals heavy damage. (Most suggestions for a lightning bolt spell involve a simple ray though.)
* Chain lightning is a spell that forks off and hits adjacent targets in a breadth-first search (see [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384784727774724121/627910565020565523/unknown.png here] for how it  might work). Possibly, the lightning bolts can only chain off at 135 or 180 degree angles (maybe 90, too).
* Lightning storm, which causes an electrical explosion centered on every monster in your line of sight (possibly with a decreasing chance of doing so as it gets further from you).
