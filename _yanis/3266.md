New shop type "boutique", which only generates in very small rooms (otherwise it's converted to a general store) and sells not-very-useful items at highly inflated prices. Also, other sorts of shops that are suitably small and have no useful items in them may be converted to boutiques. They have unique level sounds, such as "You hear a watch ticking" and "You hear someone pouring a cup of coffee".
