You can throw cursed aklyses, because the tether is still welded to your hand.
Because of this, they *always* return -- which means there actually might be
some circumstances where it's beneficial to wield one versus a non-cursed one,
for example attacking monsters in water or lava.

To compensate for this a bit, the cursed aklys could have an increased chance of
hitting you when it returns.
