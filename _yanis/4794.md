Ideas for a leprechaun race:
- Gets unlimited gold-stealing attacks that allow you to teleport each time you
  steal gold from a monster's inventory or beneath their feet, which allows you
  to set up teleportations in advance by luring a monster onto a pile of gold
  pieces. Stealing gold gives +1 alignment record.
- Has weak attribute maximums.
- Can enchant any boots to +7.
- Has naturally better AC from being smaller, or instead you sometimes
  automatically leap and evade in response to an incoming attack.
- Rigid body armor won't fit because of the small size.
- Luck either starts temporarily at +1 or times out permanently to +1.
