A new role (or possibly just a new mechanic attached to something like Infidel)
flavored on being a cultist. The key feature is being able to create a summoning
circle on the ground and somehow expend corpses inside that circle to summon a
pet; better pets can be gained at higher levels or with more powerful monsters'
corpses.
