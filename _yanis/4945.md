New monster spell that gives the player intrinsic levitation for a few dozen
turns. The levitation can't be canceled (possibly unless the player drinks a
blessed potion of levitation or casts levitation at Skilled or Expert to gain
control over when they land). The spell possibly would not require being cast at
melee range, and could occur at a distance. The intent here is to create more
tactically interesting situations where the player is prevented from getting
anything on the ground.
