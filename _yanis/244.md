Gods' "Prove thyself worthy or perish" message should be flavored as "Prove
thyself worthy, because I can do no more for you". On the Planes, the gods'
balance of power should prevent your deity from granting you any extra help
(apart from sending angels when you arrive in Astral). If this were not the
case, one would expect to be able to breeze through the Planes, with your god
smiting down any enemy that might threaten you getting them their Amulet. Prayer
will not work, though it will still break atheist conduct.
