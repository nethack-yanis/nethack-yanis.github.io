Gloves of skill (or "gauntlets of weapon mastery"): magical gloves which raise
your effective skill level in your wielded weapon by 1.
* If you're Restricted in your weapon, this only treats you as Unskilled, not
  Basic.
* If you're Expert in your weapon, they do nothing.
* If the gloves are cursed, they instead reduce skill level by 1, and if they
  become cursed while wearing them and wielding a weapon, you get a message
  about how you find it more awkward to wield your weapon.
* Also, you get a message about holding your weapon more confidently when you
  put them on and your effective skill is raised. This automatically identifies
  them as well.
