Lawful and neutral gods should respect any conducts you currently have when
giving you stuff:
* If you have been illiterate, they will not give you a spellbook.
* If you have been weaponless, they will not give you artifact weapons (maybe
  could give a +1 intrinsic damage bonus instead).
* If you have been pacifist, they may send tame minions.

Meanwhile, chaotic gods will ignore these rules and give you whatever.
