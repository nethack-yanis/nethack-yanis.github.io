Tree blights that are hiding and motionless should actually use the game's
"appear as furniture" system to appear fully as dead trees, so that even if you
farlook them they just show up as "dead tree". Currently they have the same
ASCII glyph but appear as "tree blight" in farlook, allowing you to trivially
scan the map and confirm any suspicious-looking dead trees to be blights or not.
This would also enable the tree blight tile to be distinct from the dead tree
tile.
