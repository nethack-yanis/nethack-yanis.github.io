Reduce the ability of holy water to bless large objects and stacks, by telling
the player "Your [item(s)] is too large to dip into one bottle". From there, it
could either prompt "Use X bottles instead?", tell you you don't currently have
enough potions, or suggest you apply multiple potions instead of dipping.

Small and single objects would still be blessable by using one potion.
