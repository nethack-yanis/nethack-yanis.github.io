If you happen to get teleported while you are _ traveling and you have teleport control, the cursor is automatically placed on where you wanted to travel to. (It doesn't automatically teleport you there - you are still able to move the cursor around before doing the teleport.)

Possibly, add an option to toggle this behavior off, though it's hard to imagine why someone wouldn't want it.
