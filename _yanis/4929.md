If you quit while on the Astral Plane, your game creates a special type of bones
file which only contains the details of your character and their possessions
(minus a real Amulet of Yendor, with a fake one added).

When other players reach Astral, their games can load this file to create an NPC
of your character replacing one of the generic player monsters on Astral.
