Put a cap on the number of weapons in a stack that can be enchanted by a single enchant weapon scroll. Maybe 20 for ammunition and 5 or 7 for other stacking weapons like daggers. It's odd that you can multiply the total amount of enchantment points you're getting just by wielding a larger number of weapons.
