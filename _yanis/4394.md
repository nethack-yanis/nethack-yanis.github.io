A cursed amulet of reflection will behave as an "amulet of absorption": instead
of reflecting rays, nearby ones that weren't going to hit you get redirected
towards you instead. Also, rays that hit an amulet of absorption wearer don't
continue past them.

Alternatively, add the amulet of absorption as its own item, and make it
usually generate cursed like other "bad" amulets.
