Genetic engineers either generate with a potion of polymorph, or have a chance
of dropping one when killed. If they generate with it, monster AI should be
changed so monsters are capable of throwing polymorph potions at the player, and
possibly so that genetic engineers *always* throw it rather than drinking it.
