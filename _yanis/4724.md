If you are at low HP and transformed due to lycanthropy, praying to your god
should fix the lycanthropy rather than fixing the low HP, which is nearly
useless since it's polyform HP. If they decide to fix multiple troubles, and
your regular form is then at low HP, they should consider that as another
trouble to fix.
