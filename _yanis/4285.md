New artifact _Staff of Agni_, a quarterstaff with the following fire-based
properties:
* Can be zapped if its enchantment is positive for the same effect as casting a
  spell of fireball.
* Invoking it sets its enchantment to 3 + your skill in attack spells. (No
  effect if the enchantment is already higher than this.)
* Grants fire resistance when wielded.
* Deals double fire damage in melee like Fire Brand.
* Acts like a robe for reducing spellcasting failure, but only for the spell of
  fireball (and fire storm, if that is a separate spell).
