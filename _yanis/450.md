Artifact chaotic amulet *Amulet of Splendor*: provides every single amulet effect, as well as unchanging-ignoring controlled polyself when invoked. Wearing it conveys life saving (this WILL disintegrate the amulet if triggered), magical breathing, unchanging, poison resistance, ESP, reflection, strangulation (doesn't kill you due to magical breathing but maybe it makes it so you can't eat food or something while wearing it, or it autocurses), restful sleep, and gender change for as long as you wear the amulet. Base type is a cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor.
