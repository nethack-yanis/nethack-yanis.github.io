The game doesn't adequately signal that sinking in lava while fire resistant
will become fatal given time. There are a few possible solutions depending on
how much the model of "dissolved in molten lava" is changed:
* Messages involving sinking in lava should indicate more clearly to the player
  that even though they are fire resistant, they will eventually die by sinking
  below the surface and dissolving. Possibly separate messages when the timeout
  is getting low, such as "You are beginning to dissolve." and "You are
  dissolving faster."
* Sinking in lava while fire resistant is fine, and doesn't kill the hero if
  they have magical breathing. The death that occurs if they don't is changed to
  "drowned in molten lava". This could mean the hero can swim through lava so
  long as they retain both fire resistance and magical breathing.
* Sinking in lava dissolves parts of the hero's body as they go deeper, causing
  progressively increasing amounts of HP damage, probably fractions of maximum
  HP, which eventually go over 100% as they slip fully underneath and kill them
  outright even if they've been healing the damage every time. Messages would
  also need to be updated.
