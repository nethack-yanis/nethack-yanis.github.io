Implement a strangulation or "can't breathe" timer, which unifies strangulation, suffocation, food choking, rope golem choking, and drowning, and also provides a clean way for monsters to have a suffocation attack.
* This means that choking over food is no longer instantaneous. Each turn while choking over food, you have a 20% chance to vomit and lose 1000 nutrition. At certain points while the strangulation timer is getting closer to 0, you take one point of Con damage.
* Drowning monsters now grab and pull you underwater in 1 turn, but you have until the timer runs out to kill the monster or escape in some other way. Lifesaving while drowning does not give you a free escape, but resets the drowning timer.
* Rope golems are now more dangerous, since they represent a delayed instadeath.
