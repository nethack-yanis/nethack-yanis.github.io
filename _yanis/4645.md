Orcish Town should have a peaceful orcish priest of Moloch in its temple, to
make it less of a bad level. Depending on perspective, this could be at odds
with the inital reason for adding Orcish Town, which was to make the protection
racket an unreliable strategy, but since it would be very hard to get to the
orcish priest successfully it might not be.
