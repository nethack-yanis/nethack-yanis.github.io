New "pauper" conduct, in which you are not allowed to gain any gold pieces in
your inventory (gold items like the gold ring and Candelabrum are fine, because
they aren't money).

An interesting side effect is that you can't sell things in a shop since the
shopkeeper will give you money directly for them, unless you manage to somehow
remove all the shopkeeper's gold, enabling you to sell and buy things for store
credit.
