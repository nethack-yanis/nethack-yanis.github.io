A new object or, more likely, an artifact which is a ring of enlightenment.
Wearing it increases Intelligence and Wisdom by 1. Additionally, when you
perform the #attributes command, you are shown your fire, cold, shock, poison,
and sleep resistance statuses. Possibly it can be invoked for full
enlightenment.
