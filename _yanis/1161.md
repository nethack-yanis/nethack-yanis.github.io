Muzzles that can be put on pets so they stop eating food off the floor. Uncursed ones block their eating 90% of the time; blessed 100%; and cursed ones weld to the pet's face and prevent it from eating anything until it starves or the curse is removed. May also decrease tameness when put on the pet.
