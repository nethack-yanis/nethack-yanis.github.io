A new magical gray stone provisionally called a "curse-eater". If you are
carrying one in your main inventory, every time you are hit with a curse items
effect, the gray stone absorbs the curse instead and loses one level of
beatitude. If it absorbs a curse while already cursed, it crumbles.

Carrying multiple stones will make a curse items effect hit only one of the
stones, chosen randomly.
