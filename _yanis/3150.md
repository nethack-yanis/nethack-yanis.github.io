Revamp luck so that it's mostly permanent and tied to game milestones such as Oracle, Sokoban completion, clearing Medusa, passing the Castle, finishing the Quest, and getting crowned. All of these increase base luck by 1 (like the full moon benefit, only more so.) Carried luckitems adjust by -2 if they're "net cursed", +2 if net uncursed, and +4 if net blessed. All other things that affect luck still do, with no way to prevent them timing out back to the new base value.
