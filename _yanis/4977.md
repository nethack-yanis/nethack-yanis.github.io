You should be able to wish for "identified" on an object, which makes the object
arrive identified. For instance, wishing for an identified magic marker would
mean you already know its charges and don't need to spend some other
identification resource on them.

This is intended to accompany #4914, so that the player doesn't always just wish
for identification because they sometimes have more important things to put on
the wish.
