Write a Lua script that involves orcs spawning en masse and sacking Minetown -
after an ordinary Minetown has already generated, so the attack happens during
the game rather than before it. The neat thing about it is that it would be
generic enough to be used in any Minetown, rather than being limited to the
existing Orcish Town.
