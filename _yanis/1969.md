There should be three ways to interact with potions: drinking them, getting them
splashed on the exterior of your body (e.g. having them thrown at you and hit
you), and inhaling their vapors. These should all be fully symmetric between the
player and monsters and have noticeable effects for most if not all potions.

The key missing one to implement is the "topical" potion effects. Currently, the
only potion with topical effects is acid, and thrown potions only do vapor
effects to the monster they hit, which is often weak and ineffective. Topical
effects would probably be best implemented as working the same as quaffing the
potion, or a bit weaker. This would also be useful for buffing potions that
monsters throw at the hero: the vapor effects of, say, a potion of blindness are
so short that it doesn't make much sense for the monster to throw it rather than
doing something else, but if blindness splashing in your eyes causes a
significantly longer duration, it makes more sense.
