Whenever an antimatter vortex annihilates an object or monster, it should
behave like actual antimatter would and produce an explosion, losing some HP in
the process. This allows a player to defeat them by throwing junk at them to
reduce their HP until they die, but if there is no junk available the player
will have to sacrifice some valuable item.
