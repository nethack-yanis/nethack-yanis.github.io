It should be possible to learn the enchantment of a weapon without formal
identification. This could be accomplished by any of the following:
* Rubbing it on a blessed touchstone
* Making a number of successful hits with it
* SLASH'EM's weapon practice technique
* Making a number of attempted hits with it (they don't have to hit)
