Easter egg: a comestible that has very low weight and very high nutrition, thus
a very good food to have. They generate very rarely, perhaps only 1-3 per game
on average, and generate exclusively in hidden spots: in chests, closets, and
vaults, the dead ends of mazes, beneath sinks (revealed when you step onto the
sink), in trees (revealed either when you step next to the tree or kick it),
etc. The glyph is brightly colored, perhaps purple.
