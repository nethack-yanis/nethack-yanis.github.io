New monster 'chicken', added to the c monster class, but it is a normal chicken
with no special attributes or powers. Eating its corpse gives some chicken
related YAFM, and wielding its corpse and hitting a monster with it may make
them flee; a comment in the code should indicate that this is because they are
"chickening out".
