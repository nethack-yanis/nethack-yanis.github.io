An auction special level, where players can go to sell items like magic lamps
and artifacts that are considered too powerful to go in the swap chest. Over the
next 24 or 48 hours, the item is up for auction and then goes to the highest
bidder. Bids start at 20,000 zorkmids and the minimum increase is 500.

Alternatively, this could be on a very short time limit of 30 minutes to an
hour, which would prevent people from having to park their games for days but
would probably result in a lot of stuff being auctioned off cheaply.
