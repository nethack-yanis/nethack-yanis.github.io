Candles of invocation have their effect trigger some smallish number of turns (maybe 5-20) after it's lit, so that you can't rely on having whatever their effect is available in a pinch and have to plan out its use beforehand. When the effect triggers before the candle is out of fuel, it is consumed anyway.
