Give potions more side dipping effects:
* Dipping an eroded item in a healing potion repairs erosion on it; 1 level for regular healing, 2 for extra healing, and 3 for full healing. Restore ability will repair all erosion as well.
* Dipping a negatively enchanted item in a restore ability potion reverts it to +0 if the potion is blessed, adds 1 point if uncursed, and does nothing if cursed.
* Dipping an enchantable item in a gain ability potion enchants it (by 1 point, always).
* Dipping an uncharged item (possibly excluding rings) into restore ability has the same effect as uncursed charging it. (Blessed charging cannot be reproduced this way, even if the potion is blessed).
