Spell of create undead: turns a corpse you're standing on (or adjacent to you) into a tame undead, but only if an undead monster exists for that kind of corpse. Zombies at low levels, then mummies; eventually higher-level stuff like skeletons and maybe even vampires. Possibly creates wraiths or ghosts for other types of corpses of intelligent but no-undead-counterpart monsters. Can be used on corpses of slain undead.
