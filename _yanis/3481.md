New branch named "The Ancient Library". It is likely accessed by portal from the
main dungeon rather than stairs. It contains some spellbooks and a smaller
number of scrolls, which serve as the main loot of this branch, but there aren't
*too* many of them in order not to be unbalancing. The level design makes it
still visibly a structure, but fairly ruined with collapsed walls and such.

The branch is populated by monsters of a new species that either serve as the
guardians of the library, or have moved in to inhabit it after its decline. They
make for a difficult fight, and compounding the problem, taking a book will
awaken and anger all of them on the current level. (Or the books spawn embedded
in the walls -- bookshelves, and you need to kick the walls to get them out,
which triggers this.) There is no singular boss monster in the branch, nor is
there any singular reward item.

If bookworms ([#1793](1793.html)) are implemented, they also appear in this
branch.
