Applying an axe or pick-axe, and then specifying a direction where there is a monster, makes you swing the implement through the air, because applying tools is not intended for attacking, and it helps avoid weaponless conduct breaking.

Alternatively, when autodig is off and a digging tool wielded, you must use F to attack monsters.
