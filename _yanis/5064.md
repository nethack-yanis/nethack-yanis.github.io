It should be possible to build up a resistance to a potion by drinking or
inhaling fumes from it too frequently, making it work less effectively on you or
not at all. This goes for both negative potions, which is good because monsters
can't use them as effectively against you, but also positive ones, which is bad
because you will stop getting as much benefit out of them.
