Alternate design of Fort Ludios that has a bigger, three-part fort containing a
room with multiple copies of "Croesus", one of which is the real one and the
others are different monsters in disguise.

The idea here is to reinforce the implication that he regularly uses different
guises to guard his riches, which explains why you can so easily lie to guards
that you are Croesus in a better way than them just being super gullible.
