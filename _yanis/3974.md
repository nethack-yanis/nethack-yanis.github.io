New role, the Artificer:
* Artificers can innately see charges on things and use wands at a higher skill
  level than everyone else.
* Starts with an inventory of consumables comparable to vanilla wizards', a
  scroll of charging, offensive wands, a magic marker, and random tools.
* Starts with all armors (magic and nonmagic) identified and all tools
  identified.
* Restricted in nearly all weapon skills like a monk, or can only reach Basic in
  a few ones like knife.
* Quest involves lots of golems.
* Quest artifact grants double damage with tools and gives blessed charging when
  invoked.
* Gnome is a playable race.
* Has a special tool, an artificer's knife, which they can use for ring
  crafting. This works by removing the gem from the ring and replacing it with
  another gem. Not specified how this works for non-gem rings or rings
  containing things like black onyx or pearl which aren't obtainable gems;
  possibly these are just uncraftable. Crafting a ring like this may destroy it
  depending on the beatitude of the knife, 75%/90%/99% for B/U/C for
  non-Artificers, 20%/50%/80% for Artificers.
