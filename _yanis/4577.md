Intrinsic teleportitis gained from eating corpses is temporary if you don't
already have it. Eating additional corpses while having the temporary intrinsic
has a chance (less than 100%) of providing the intrinsic permanently.

Eating a ring of teleportation should probably be unchanged: if you digest the
magic in the ring, you always get the permanent intrinsic.
