Additional temporary effects accompany drinking a potion of booze. The effects wear off when the confusion does (so if you extend it by, say, drinking a potion of confusion, the effects are prolonged). There is consensus that there should be both positive and negative effects; all of the following have been proposed:
* A damage bonus, or even double damage
* Temporary HP
* An accuracy penalty
* If you're a dwarf, the effects get magnified
* If there is any such thing as a player-is-scared effect, it is canceled when you drink the booze and blocked while you're under the influence.
* Any AC from your armor is nullified (this would also contribute to monk "drunken boxing" proposals, since monks don't usually have as much armor AC)
