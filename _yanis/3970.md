The wield slot is fairly underused among object classes, and there are a number
of interesting bonuses we can add to spells if the corresponding spellbook is
wielded.
* Decreases failure rate of the wielded spell (utility spells might need to be
  made higher-level/harder to cast to maintain balance).
* Or decreases Pw cost of the wielded spell.
* Allows you to cast the wielded spell even if completely forgotten.
* Allows you to cast the spell without knowing it already - the Z menu gets an
  additional "-" option to cast from the spellbook in hand if you don't know
  what that book is.
  * Casting from an unknown spellbook will immediately check for reading success
    as if you had read the book: if you succeed, it then moves on to other
    checks like whether you have enough power, etc and you may cast the spell.
    If you fail, you get a random failure effect appropriate to that spellbook.
