Don't allow items to erode past the point where further erosion stops
mattering. For instance, a orcish helm can lose at most 1 AC from eroding, so
it should not be allowed to become very or thoroughly rusty, whereas plate mail
can lose 3 AC from eroding, so it should be allowed to become thoroughly rusty.
