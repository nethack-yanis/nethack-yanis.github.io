When you would shatter an enemy's weapon with a two-handed weapon, and the enemy's weapon is a bow, replace the shattering message with one about cutting/snapping the bow string. If it's not a bow, but it's made out of a non-brittle material such as metal, change it to "Foo's weapon is sundered from the force of your blow!"
