When Schroedinger's Box is probed or has a stethoscope applied to it, it either reveals the housecat corpse inside or releases the live housecat as normal. Alternatively, stethoscopes give "You hear a characteristic WOM WOM WOM sound" as a reference to Bob the Angry Flower, and probing gives you "The box contains a cat that is neither alive nor dead nor alive nor dead nor...  You resolve to call the YSPCA later."
