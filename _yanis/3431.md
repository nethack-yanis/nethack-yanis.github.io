A new type of trap called a "conduct trap" that spawns in Gehennom. Triggering
one causes Moloch to enforce one of the in-game conducts on you for the rest of
the game, or until you next break it, even if you have previously broken it.
Breaking it after this happens makes Moloch mete out some sort of harsh
punishment.
