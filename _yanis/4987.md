Picking up objects manually should be a free, repeatable action. This is because
autopickup is a free action, so it is optimal and tedious (but relevant if you
are trying for a low-turncount game) to look at what's on the square you're
about to move to, go into the options menu and adjust pickup_types and
autopickup exceptions so you will pick up the things you want on that square,
and repeat constantly every time you would have used the manual pickup command.

However, this does not fix the issue where autopickup will still allow you to
pick up objects on squares you are going to be forced off, such as the gray
stones on levelporters in Mines' End.
