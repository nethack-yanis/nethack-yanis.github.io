Remove holy/unholy water's ability to bless/curse items. Instead, make blessed
and cursed _oil_ serve the same functions. Dipping a stack of uncursed oil in
holy/unholy oil will bless or curse the stack, as currently works, but since oil
is significantly less easy to get than water, this makes mass-blessing of items
harder to accomplish.

Anointing an item with holy or unholy oil ignores effects that would normally
happen because of the oil. For instance, dipping an oil lamp in holy oil will
just bless it, or do nothing if it was blessed already.

Priests now start with a stack of 4 holy oil.

Water doesn't get outright removed - other things still dilute to it and turn
into it in random alchemy - but it's not much use anymore except for on-the-go
dilution.

Not specified whether you could pray to get a stack of oil potions on an altar
blessed, or whether this wouldn't work.
