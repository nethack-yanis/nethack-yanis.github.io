A magic arrow spell, modeled off a similar spell in GnollHack. It is a level 1
spell that shoots a magic arrow at a single enemy for 1d6 damage and never
misses. Possible variations include boosting the damage to 2d6 but allowing it
to miss, or allowing it to be smite-targeted at any enemy in a radius with a
direct unobstructed path.
