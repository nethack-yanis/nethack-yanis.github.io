Add a "randomizer mode", a non-scoring mode enabled by some option you put in
the config file that randomly mutates the stats of each monster -- for
instance, in one particular game, gnomes could have fewer hit dice and thus
lower HP, while soldier ants gain an ice attack.

In the spirit of traditional randomizers, this could also randomize loot, for
things like artifacts and invocation items being mixed up and findable in
regular chests, monsters generating with and dropping gear they shouldn't have,
etc.
