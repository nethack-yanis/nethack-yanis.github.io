Shallow water shouldn't be a free and easy method of diluting potions
infinitely. Instead, it should have a chance of contaminating or polluting the
potion (or turning it to a potion of sickness), where polluted potions can't
just be re-dipped to dilute them to water or cancelled back to water. Or instead
of dealing with polluted potions, just have a chance of losing the potion
entirely.
