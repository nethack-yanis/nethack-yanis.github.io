The enchantment on non-blessed weapons degrades by 1 point after a certain
number of hits, roughly 100. Cursed weapons degrade in half the number of hits.
Possibly, this auto-identifies the enchantment when it happens.

There could be some mechanism to prevent degradation by resetting the counter on
a weapon, such as using a whetstone on it. (Not that this makes sense for
non-slashing weapons.)
