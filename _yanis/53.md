Any gaze attack which is prevented by blindness (one which is visual in nature) is prevented by hallucination, or at least the effects are reduced or mitigated. Possibly archons' blinding gaze should be exempted from this, with the hallucinatory message being "The power of the Aurora overwhelms you!"
