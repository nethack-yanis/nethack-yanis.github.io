Monsters should be immune, or less likely, to turn to flee if you have aggravate
monster. This should probably only affect monsters fleeing after being harmed in
combat, rather than all forms of scaring.

The stated goal of this is so that Knights who are tired of taking caitiff
penalties on fleeing monsters can give themselves aggravate monster to sidestep
the penalty.
