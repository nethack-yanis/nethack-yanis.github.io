Buff Cavemen by making them especially good at taming monsters, possibly
giving them an exclusive mechanism to tame animals without a scroll or spell, in
reference to how early humans domesticated many animal species.

This probably works best as ordinary taming, but a wackier take on it would be
turning monsters into a domestic form, such as taming a jackal and it becoming a
dog.
