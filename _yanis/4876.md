Since a black dragon disintegrates you if you touch it, you should also
disintegrate if you try to do anything with its corpse, like eating, kicking,
or tinning it. If you interact with the corpse by doing something where gloves
or boots would logically touch it, those disintegrate first instead.

If you somehow manage to acquire a tin of black dragon meat, you can eat it
safely to get disintegration resistance, on the general principle of tins that
the dangerous part has been removed from the food.
