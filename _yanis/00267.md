Yellow lights possibly have a light radius of larger than 1. Also add white lights, white-colored y-class monsters which have a light radius of 3 or 4, with a blinding gaze attack and no explosion attack (unless keeping the explosion attack is too thematic to the y class, in which case it should blind for a long time).
