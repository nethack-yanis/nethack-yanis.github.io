If you have polymorph control, you can control what any item dipped into a
potion of polymorph will become, respecting existing polymorph restrictions
(i.e. not controlling the number of charges something will get, and incrementing
the recharge count). This allows it to act basically like limited
wishing, but it may be okay given the rarity of polymorph potions.
