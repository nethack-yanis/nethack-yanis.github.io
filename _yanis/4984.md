Overhaul the dungeon as follows:
- The endgame is extremely dangerous, to the point where it will kill most
  heroes by default no matter how well-prepared they are.
- Every branch you complete removes an aspect of the endgame's danger. (Not
  specified if the existing dungeon branches count towards this, or if they
  should only be new branches.)
- Branches are themselves dangerous, and each one requires a non-renewable
  resource to "unlock". Not specified if this resource is the same or different
  for different branches.

The idea is to create different choices and tradeoffs, and to force the player
to take uncomfortable or unanticipated routes.
