When a wand of cancellation is placed into a bag of holding, rather than blowing
it up, it instead uses up (all of?) the wand's charges and turns the bag into a
sack.

For consistency, bags of holding should probably turn into sacks when zapped
with cancellation as well.

This forces potentially interesting choices on cursed bags of holding in bones
files, since now cancellation cannot safely be used to loot all the contents and
get the bag too.
