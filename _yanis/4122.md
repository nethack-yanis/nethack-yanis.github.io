On deeper levels, land mines cause a fiery explosion in addition to their
existing effects. Player-placed land mines get a bit trickier; a simple
implementation will just consider the depth of the level the trap is on, but
a more correct one would track via a field on the land mine object (in case it
is picked up and carried around to another level) whether or not it will produce
an explosion when triggered.
