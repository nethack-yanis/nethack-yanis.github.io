An artifact rock of detect ants, which conveys warning of all a-class monsters
(or possibly only ants) when carried. If it enters your inventory and there are
ants on the level, or you enter a new level containing ants when the previous
level had none, you get a message "You feel antsy". There are corresponding
messages "You feel less antsy" for when you no longer detect any ants.
