Hookshot, a tool that shoots a retractable point on a chain and then pulls
things together when the chain retracts. In practice, this should probably be
implemented as an invisible beam that gets shot in the player-chosen direction,
with a short range of only 3 or 4 squares. It has various effects depending on
what it hits:
* Wall or furniture: Player is dragged towards that space.
* Boulder or solid stone: Goes "Clink!" and does nothing. (Except maybe if the
  player is a giant, they can drag the boulder to themselves with it.)
* Monster: Either deals small damage, or yanks the player and monster together.
  The relative weights of the player and monster determine who gets yanked more
  (could be either or both).
