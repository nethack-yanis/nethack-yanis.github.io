When you controlled levelport to level 0, Nowhere, monsters that normally follow
you through a levelport will do the same here (because they don't know where
you're going). This will kill all of them and make them cease to exist, the same
as you, but you can survive as usual with an amulet of life saving. This
effectively allows you to controlled levelport to 0 to dispose of any monsters
that would follow you.

Note: because it depends on levelporting to level 0, it won't work when carrying
the Amulet or in the End Game.
