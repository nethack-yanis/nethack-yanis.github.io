Shambling horrors gain their own mextra struct which contains details of their statblock, rather than overwriting the shambling horror's own statblock in the mons[] array. This allows horrors from a bones file to retain the characteristics they had in the bones game, alongside horrors from the current game that have different characteristics.

It may be possible to look up the attacks and abilities of a given shambler on the map by farlook.
