When you perform a controlled polymorph, you are only able to turn into
monsters which have HD equal to or lower than your level. If you are using a
mask, or if you are polymorphing randomly, it treats you as being 10 levels
higher than your actual one.

Lycanthropic and vampire shapeshifting polymorphs are exempt from this
restriction.
