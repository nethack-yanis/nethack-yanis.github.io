Change the Master Key of Thievery's invoke power, since it already gives you
guaranteed untrapping passively. The new invoke power is to magic map a moderate
radius around you (maybe 10) and then teleport you (which will be controlled
because the Key gives you teleport control), but you must pick a space within
the mapped radius to teleport to.
