Based on some new code in 3.7 that tracks how an artifact was generated, allow
the player to ask the Oracle about the existence of an artifact. The code isn't
in place for her to tell you where it actually is, but she will be able to tell
you whether it generated randomly, in bones, from a gift, etc. Possible messages
for some of these:
* Artifact came into the game via a bones file: "Another adventurer carried this
  to their grave, which thou hast already approached. Search around such an
  area."
* Randomly generated: "It has lain somewhere in this dungeon for a long time,
  awaiting the next hero. Thou hast already passed near to it."
* Via naming, wishing or dipping in a fountain: "I am confused. Thou thyself
  were present when this artifact came into existence."
* Via a gift: "Did not the gods bestow this on thee personally?"
