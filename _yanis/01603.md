The *Staff of Necromancy*: an artifact quarterstaff that deals double damage to non-drain-resistant creatures (but doesn't life-drain them as the Staff of Aesculapius does), grants cold resistance and curse resistance when wielded, and can be invoked to raise one vertebrate corpse on your square as a tame skeleton.
