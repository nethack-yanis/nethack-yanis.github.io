Uranium wands have a small but persistent chance of causing radiation-based
effects: "[The wand] momentarily glows with a sinister green light!" or "The
wand momentarily feels very warm!" When this happens, one of two effects
happens, each with a 50% chance: the victim takes 2d6 points of damage unless
poison resistant, or the victim polymorphs.

The chances are as follows:
* 1/100,000 per turn while carried in the hero's or a monster's main inventory
  (carrying it in a container makes it safe)
* 1/500 chance if zapped at yourself, up, or down, or if the wand is
  non-directional
* 1/2,000 chance if engraved with or zapped in a direction
* Stacking 12.5% chance per charge in the wand, up to a maximum of 75%, if it is
  broken or explodes, to any monsters in the 9 squares affected by the explosion
