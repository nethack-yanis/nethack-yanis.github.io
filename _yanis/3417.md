If you chat to a peaceful spellcaster creature who is carrying a spellbook while
carrying or wielding a spellbook yourself, it may offer to trade.

This might be of limited utility since only aligned priests in vanilla normally
carry spellbooks, or it might be well suited to a variant like FIQHack where
spellcasters usually have a book or two.
