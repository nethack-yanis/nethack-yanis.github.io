A monster spell 'curse weapon' or 'curse equipment', a clerical spell that is a weaker version of curse items: it only curses one item, but selects from among worn and wielded objects. If the target isn't wearing or wielding anything, it will target one piece of equippable gear from their inventory, or failing that a random item.
