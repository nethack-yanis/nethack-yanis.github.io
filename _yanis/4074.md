Change the HP and/or Pw regeneration formulas (natural regeneration, not from
external sources) so that it regenerates faster in the early game but more
slowly in the late game.

This fixes existing balance problems -- that the hero doesn't regain them fast
enough early on, and by later on they regain them so fast it trivializes
problems -- but would be very strange to justify flavor wise.
