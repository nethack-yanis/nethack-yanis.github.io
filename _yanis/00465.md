The Oracle now prompts the user to ask a question. Her oracularities now have associated keywords (a many-to-many relationship); if you use keywords, she will select an oracularity matching as many of them as possible. If she doesn't know what you're asking about, she gives you a random oracle. This could even be leveraged to ask about information that's normally hidden from the player; for example, asking about the Sokoban reward or the location of branch stairs.
