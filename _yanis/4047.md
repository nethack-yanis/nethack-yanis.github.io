You can attune pets to the Lyre of Orpheus (possibly only if you are a bard and
it's your own quest artifact). Attuned pets that die near the harp leave no
corpse (so they can't be resurrected twice via undead turning), but can be
resurrected later by invoking it. This replaces its current invoke power.

For a more balanced implementation (so you can't let multiple pets die over
thousands of turns and then invoke it to get an instant army), it will only
resurrect one pet, possibly allowing the player to pick which.

For a simpler implementation, only the last attuned pet to have died near the
Lyre gets resurrected.
