Make it impossible to have fire and cold resistance intrinsically at the same
time. If you eat a corpse that gains you one, you lose the other. Things like
crowning that give you both now do not give either (unless perhaps you have
neither, in which case you get a random one).

Extrinsic fire and cold resistance are not affected. This makes it valuable to
have those extrinsics from a ring, underused colors of dragon armor, or an
artifact.

All polymorphable monsters that currently resist both fire and cold must have
one of those resistances taken away; otherwise you could have both at once by
polymorphing into them.
