Add the turn a pet was created into the edog struct, so the game can measure how long and loyal of a relationship you have with it. Pets that stay tame for a long time get some combat buffs such as a damage boost or more hit points. They are also more likely to come back tame if killed and resurrected.

Note that if a pet is momentarily untamed and then retamed, it resets the "turn it became a pet" counter.
