New artifact *Gauntlets of Throwing*: unspecified base type, adds +1 to the
multishot cap for thrown missiles only (not ammo fired from a launcher). When
multishooting, only one actual item is thrown; the rest are temporary summoned
copies of the one thrown with the same stats, which vanish after their flight is
complete.
