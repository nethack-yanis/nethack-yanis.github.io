It should be possible to push a boulder over a mimic imitating an object or
dungeon feature. The mimic should not react in any way until the player tries to
occupy the space themselves.

The only exception is if the mimic is imitating a boulder, which would then be
large enough to stop you from pushing another boulder into its space.
