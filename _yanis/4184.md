Everlasting gobstopper, a food item that you start sucking on when you eat it,
providing a constant d2 nutrition per turn. It never gets used up, but once you
spit it out (by choosing to eat something else or by using "-" with the eat
command) it is no good anymore and gets used up. If you get oversatiated by not
spitting it out, you can indeed choke and die on it.
