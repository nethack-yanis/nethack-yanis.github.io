Aggravate monster from a ring (and only from that) gives pets a special behavior: as they are aggravated, they will attack enemies with no regard to their current HP or the enemy's level, basically ignoring the checks that exist. Enemies might also attack pets of their own volition (which they don't do under normal circumstances except in retaliation).
