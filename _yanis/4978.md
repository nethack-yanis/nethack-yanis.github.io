Wand of jumping. When you zap it in a direction, the beam finds the first square
in that direction you can't occupy because a monster, boulder, wall, or edge of
the map is blocking it, and moves you to the square right before it. There is no
maximum range, meaning the "jumps" could be very long and might be better off
flavored as teleports at a certain distance. Liquids count as a square you can
occupy, so zapping it at e.g. a wall on Medusa's level with water preceding it
would result in you falling into the water and possibly drowning. Not specified
what the behavior would be if you tried to zap it diagonally through an open
door.

There is the potential issue of using this wand on the Astral Plane to zip
around much faster than usual and without needing to spend resources on jumping
boots or the spell. One possible solution is to make this wand very rare, about
as rare as the wand of enlightenment, so you find about 0-2 of them per game.
