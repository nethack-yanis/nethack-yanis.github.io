As a Peter Pan reference, produce "You hear a faint ticking noise" occasionally
and prior to the normal output when stethoscoping a crocodile. Alternatively,
produce this noise very rarely when a crocodile is anywhere on the level or near
the player. Possibly only if the crocodile's monster ID number matches a rare
condition, like being a multiple of 100.
