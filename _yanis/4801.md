The game should follow the D&D rules of what happens when a bag of holding is
placed inside another bag of holding, and send items that "vanish" to the Astral
Plane, where they get placed randomly.

As a side effect, this change would create a weird way to send items to the
Astral Plane without carrying them, but of course you wouldn't be able to rely
on them being in any particular spot.
