Since monsters implicitly know the layout of the dungeon, they can move through secret passages as if they were normal floor, and use secret doors as if they were normal doors (even unlocking them if they have a tool). If the player sees a monster on a secret door/passage, or moving onto or off it while they are also able to see both spaces of its movement, the corridor/door is made unsecret.

Alternatively, to avoid door complications, a monster using a secret door will just convert it into a normal door.
