Snow golem, which is a <span class="nhsym clr-brightcyan">'</span> monster found in icy locales. Does not generate in Gehennom. It uses a spitting attack to launch snowballs (flavored as throwing them), which are an object which behaves like spat venom in that they disappear one way or another at the end of their flight. These deal damage and possibly knockback. The encyclopedia entry for snow golems uses "Frosty the Snowman" as reference material.
