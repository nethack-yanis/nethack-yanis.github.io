You can apply an equipped small shield (or possibly other types of shields) to
attack a monster with a shield bash. This could be treated either like a blunt
weapon attack, or more likely as a special effect which has a chance of stunning
the target. Stunning odds could be higher for either more martial-based roles,
or could use a shield skill and scale with that.
