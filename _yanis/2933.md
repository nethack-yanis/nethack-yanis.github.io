Invoking the Longbow of Diana gives you light arrows. These are a special
object, weightless, created with the same enchantment as the Longbow, but
attempting to enchant them further will fail (maybe making the enchanted arrows
evaporate). If they leave your inventory for any reason, they will vanish. As a
weapon, they are very powerful (to the point of probably instakilling most
weaker monsters they hit). To prevent the player stockpiling them, the invoke
effect will only top up the amount of them in your inventory to 5.

When a light arrow strikes a target or falls to the ground (and vanishes in the
process), it permanently lights up the surrounding area.
