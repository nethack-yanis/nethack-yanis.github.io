If you are mostly surrounded by puddings, they will merge together all at once and engulf you. This is a delayed instadeath in several distinct stages:
1. The puddings tower over you and merge together, preventing escape. You are engulfed, but you can still do things like attack or zap a wand of opening.
2. One or two turns later, your arms and legs are grabbed. You can no longer use most items but may still be able to cast spells and read scrolls.
3. The pudding spreads over the rest of your body. You can't speak or do things that require speaking, though prayer is still possible.
4. The pudding is forced down your throat, dissolving you from the inside. This either kills you instantly or gives you a few more turns to live if you have magical breathing.
