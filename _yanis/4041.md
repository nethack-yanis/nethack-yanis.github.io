Make more artifacts creatable by naming, with reasonable restrictions based on
your role, experience level, alignment, and preexisting enchantment of the
weapon, if it is a weapon.
* Generally you must be the same alignment as the artifact, unless the artifact
  is unaligned.
* The experience level will generally be higher than players reach in the normal
  course of a game. This could vary anywhere from 15 to 30 depending on how high
  of a barrier the designer wants to put on the artifact.
* It also might not become nameable until you have accomplished certain
  milestones such as completing the Quest or being crowned.
* The enchantment matters because the enchantment gets converted into whatever
  additional magic powers the artifact has, and will get reduced to zero. (It
  can be reenchanted afterwards.)
* If the conditions are not satisfied, you fail to create the artifact.

Example: A lawful Priest who is XL 20 can create Demonbane by naming it,
provided the mace being named is +5. The enchantment turns to +0 as the magic
flows into its new anti-demon powers.
