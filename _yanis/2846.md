Cleaver can be invoked to toggle its arc-attacking on and off. This should perhaps not set its invoke timeout, since it isn't giving the player any particular benefit. However, it's a bit problematic what the default setting should be; if it starts out in no-arc mode it will be hard for players to discover that it has an arc mode at all; if it starts out in arc mode players may hit a peaceful target in their first few attacks before remembering they need to manually toggle it.

Alternatively, just prompt the player for confirmation if the attack they are about to make is obviously going to hit any peaceful or tame monsters.
