Priests get buffed effects from the invocation artifacts:
* The Bell of Opening opens things at range.
* The Candelabrum's light is brighter (or "sunlight") and affects things sensitive to light such as gremlins and vampires. The candles could also burn slower.
* The Book of the Dead either improves the power of turning undead, or makes it easier to raise the dead.
