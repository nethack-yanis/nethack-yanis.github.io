An artifact cloak (the base type is unspecified, likely a normal nonmagic cloak)
that you can apply towards an adjacent monster. If that monster has less HP than
your current experience level, it dies and is consumed by the cloak, which can
grant the cloak extrinsics it confers to the wearer. Every additional extrinsic
added may remove out one or more existing extrinsics on the cloak.

Not specified whether you need to take the cloak off to apply it at things.
