A cancellation beam that hits a creature no longer cancels the items in its inventory; it merely cancels the creature itself. On the flip side, monsters can now zap cancellation at the player; effects of cancellation on the player include draining Pw (and possibly maximum Pw if Pw hits 0) and removing magical temporary intrinsics such as invisibility, speed, and detect monsters.
