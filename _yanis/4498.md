Energy recovery rate should be leveraged more as a role differentiator -
basically, roles that are intended to cast frequently should regenerate power
faster than roles that aren't.

One way to do this is tie energy recovery strongly to Wisdom, and then bias
starting stats so that caster roles usually have high Wisdom.
