Make most if not all rings chargeable:
* Hunger / slow digestion: merge, and the positive and negative enchantment work different ways.
* Stealth works in a radius / makes monsters have to roll higher to detect you.
* Warning increases or decreases its regular radius.
* Aggravate monster works in a radius, or affects monsters' rolls for being aggravated.
* Invisibility / see invisible: work in a radius, possibly.
* Searching: radius or have it affect your chance of finding something
* Polymorph / teleportation: affect the frequency at which it triggers
* Conflict: radius or affect monster rolls
* Most other rings that confer binary trinsics like teleport control or free action or sustain ability are difficult to make chargeable.
