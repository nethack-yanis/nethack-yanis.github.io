Traps track the turn on which they were created in the trap struct. This is used to determine the age of a web; creatures will tear through an older web more easily, and with less strength, than a young one.

(Possibly, when you spend time off-level, this trap timestamp updates to account for that time, because time is frozen when you aren't on a level.)
