A Minetown variant where Frontier Town is in the process of being invaded by
orcs. Most denizens are still alive, but swarms of orcs are trying to destroy
the town, and if you are an orc the leader will try to press you into service to
join them in trashing it. If you decide to join them, all the normal Minetown
inhabitants become hostile to you but murder penalties are removed.
