Replace the Plane of Water bubbles with an initial map looking much the same with bubbles of air surrounded by water. However, instead of the bubbles moving on paths, run a fairly slow cellular automaton that shifts the water around gradually and will eventually join up the air spaces. It's possible for a bubble to collapse completely, but not if the player's in it.
