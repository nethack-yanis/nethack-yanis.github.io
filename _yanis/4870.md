The spell of change metal to wood should work on rings and wands: it turns any
metal ring or wand into a randomly selected wooden type of ring or wand. (Note
that there is currently only 1 wooden ring). If the wand of wishing happens to
be made of wood in the current game, it can't be randomly chosen.

For wands, it works the same as polymorphing, so the resulting wand will keep
its charge count, but of course unlike polymorphing it can't be repeated since
the wand will no longer be metal.
