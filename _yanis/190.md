Add a Barbarian rage mechanic (possibly an effect on Cleaver replacing its
current damage bonus) where a damage bonus is assessed based on how long ago you
last killed a monster. This idea was originally a buff to Vorpal Blade where it
beheads anything it hits if the last behead was N turns ago, but this is
unbalanced.
