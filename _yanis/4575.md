If you manage to avoid dying by sinking in lava by freezing it solid, you are
stuck to the spot for a few turns and when you escape, you leave your boots
behind (probably either destroyed, since they cannot be recovered from the solid
stone, or buried, and recoverable by digging a pit on the spot).
