Race and polyform should not be distinct; they should be merged into a single
permonst or corpsenm-like variable. Role should remain independent of race, and
perhaps every monster should be described with a monster/role pair, with the
role being null for most monsters (i.e. gnomish wizards are gnomes that are also
wizards, but jackals aren't any particular role). This might eliminate the
entire concept of player race, internally, but transferring some of the racial
effects on players (e.g. elves' sleep resistance at XL 4) might be tricky.
