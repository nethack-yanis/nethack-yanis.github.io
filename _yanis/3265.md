Add YAFMs:
* Combat messages produced when you attack a hallucinogen-distorted fog cloud
  are replaced by "You attack thick air."
* When you try to engrave when engulfed by a dust vortex: "You try to write in
  the dust, but it won't stand still!"
* When you get out of an air elemental (that you didn't kill) while
  hallucinating: "I don't think we're in Kansas anymore."
* When you attempt to move into a Mordor orc with the m prefix: "You fail to
  simply walk into the Mordor orc."
* When a sasquatch is blinded by a camera flash: "Unfortunately, that picture's
  probably going to come out blurry."
