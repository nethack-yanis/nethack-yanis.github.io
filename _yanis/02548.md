Some mechanic (possibly a ritual spell) that enchants gems by disenchanting other items. Once enchanted, a gem can be used a single-use Pw reserve, magical grenades, or (rarely and lossily) tranfer their enchantment into some other piece of gear. Gem enchantment rules follow ring enchantment rules with respect to exploding when they get too full of magic.
