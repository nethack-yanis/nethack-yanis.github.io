New artifact dagger that, when thrown, teleports you to wherever it lands. Some
attributes it might have:
- If it lands in liquid, you could be teleported to the nearest available land,
  or to the liquid square, where you promptly fall in, possibly drowning or
  burning up. A nicer implementation could prevent it from landing in liquid in
  the first place, teleporting itself elsewhere, since it would be tough to get
  out.
- If it falls to another level, you levelport to where it falls.
- If a monster somehow eats it, you teleport inside its stomach, killing it
  (unless it's capable of engulfing you, in which case you teleport to being
  engulfed inside it).
- A side proposal is that instead of a dagger, this is an artifact gem.
