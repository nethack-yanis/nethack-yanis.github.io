Vow of poverty as a conduct. It is broken by ever having money in inventory
(with a grace period of a few turns at the beginning of the game for roles that
start with money, _or_ define the conduct as never having money enter the
inventory so you can spend initial gold, _or_ a roleplay option similar to
nudist that prevents you from generating with any money).
