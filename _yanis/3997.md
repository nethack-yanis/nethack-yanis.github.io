Seperately track every different source of exercising an ability score, with
diminishing returns for repeated use of the same exercise source until that
ability score changes value, which resets it. This prevents you from spamming an
easy-to-do exercise source such as pushing boulders around or writing Elbereth,
and makes you diversify your sources of exercise.

Possibly weight the different exercise sources (e.g. successfully finishing
studying a spellbook should be worth more for Wisdom exercise than successfully
casting that spell is).
