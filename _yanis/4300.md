Some monster (a boss? The Wizard of Yendor? Imps?) will use custom taunts
against you that are taken from checking the logfile for the last three or four
ways you died.

This could also be implemented as non-verbal taunts where the monster uses the
way you died against you - e.g. if you died to a zombie, they will summon
zombies; if you fell into a pit, they will create a pit underneath you, etc.
