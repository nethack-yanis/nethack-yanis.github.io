Stealing from shops via your pet doesn't directly anger the shopkeeper, but the shopkeeper is aware of it and raises their prices to compensate and eventually won't let you reenter the shop. Alternatively, the shopkeeper simply will block the entrance as long as ''any'' monster in the shop is carrying unpaid items, but this could be circumvented with a magic whistle.
