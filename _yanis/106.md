Shopkeepers should be aware of when you use your pet to steal from their shop,
and they should raise their prices to compensate, eventually not letting you
reenter the shop. Alternatively, the shopkeeper should simply block the entrance
as long as *any* monster in the shop is carrying unpaid items, but this could
be circumvented with a magic whistle.
