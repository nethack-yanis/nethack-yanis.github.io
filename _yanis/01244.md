F corpses can be dipped into potions to make different potions: juice + violet fungus = booze, juice + yellow mold = sickness, water + green mold = acid. (Note the existence of the [Brewing Patch](https://bilious.alt.org/?149), which dissolves most F in juice to produce confusion, hallucination, booze, sleeping, and healing.)

Later suggested recipes which involve dipping a corpse in acid to dissolve it:
* Wraith corpse &rarr; potion of gain level. (Does not always succeed, to compensate for the fact that a wraith corpse doesn't always grant a level. Maybe it even has a lower success rate than getting a level from a corpse.)
* Newt corpse &rarr; potion of gain energy.
* Floating eye corpse &rarr; potion of levitation or possibly monster detection.
