Touching a disenchanter's body or corpse should be risky like a cockatrice is:
it will cause you to lose a random intrinsic, the same as if you ate the
disenchanter.

This should also happen if a disenchanter touches you and randomly picks an
armor slot to disenchant that you aren't currently wearing anything in.
