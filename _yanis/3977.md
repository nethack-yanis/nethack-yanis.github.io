Falling rock traps can dump multiple rocks onto you at once, up to (depth/4).
Damage is taken for each rock. If a trap would drop 4 or more rocks on you, it
may instead drop (rocks/4) boulders on your head instead. Helms should be less
effective at reducing damage from falling rocks, and almost useless at reducing
damage from falling houlders.

If multiple boulders are dropped, they might be dropped on nearby spaces as
well, so that a pathway might end up blocked.
