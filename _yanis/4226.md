Celery, a comestible which uniquely has negative nutrition (because in real
life, it takes a human body more calories to digest the celery than are in the
celery.) The main use of this negative nutrition is to unsatiate yourself so you
can continue eating other food.

It should be a large amount of negative nutrition in order to be worthwhile, but
at the same time shouldn't be instadeath for unsuspecting new players by
immediately starving them. To that end, special case it so that it does not harm
you if you are Hungry or worse, is worth -30 nutrition if "not hungry", and is
worth more negative nutrition if Satiated, possibly scaling up the more satiated
you are.

Depending on implemenetation, it could either be safe or unsafe to eat when
oversatiated - realism dictates it should be unsafe to eat, but gameplay
dictates it would be useful in fewer situations unless it is always safe to eat.
Or have it count as a small positive nutritional value assessed before maybe
choking, followed by a large negative nutritional value assessed after you
didn't choke.

Knights still incur alignment penalties for eating celery while satiated.

The celery also crunches loudly whenever eating it, so it wakes up nearby
sleeping monsters.
