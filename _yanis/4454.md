Add special "reduced" effects for the diluted potion of polymorph.

Objects dipped in it will change their material, but not their type. The
material is constrained to non-exotic ones the object could naturally generate
with.

Monsters who have it smashed on them or who quaff it will try to polymorph into
a different monster of the same class. If none are available, they follow the
ordinary monster-polymorph logic.
