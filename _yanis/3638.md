New artifact *The Stage Magician's Gloves*: some form of gloves, possibly
special-cased to appear white. They allow you to use wands like a stethoscope,
with one free zap per turn, and also confer magic resistance when worn. When
invoked, if you are wearing a non-cursed hat or helm, you pull a random item or
small or tiny monster out of your hat. If not wearing a hat you get YAFM.
