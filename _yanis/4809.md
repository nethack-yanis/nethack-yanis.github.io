Make paranoid trap not a universal option, but tied to gear: certain "careful"
pieces of gear such as elven boots passively warn you of known traps before you
step into them.

Alternatively, add a ring of paranoia which enables the paranoid warnings for
traps and liquids. Or simply add this functionality to the ring of warning.
