Various proposals for things to happen on St. Patrick's Day:
- Leprechauns should get buffed. There are various ways this could be done;
  probably the easiest is giving them more starting gold but also increasing the
  damage of their attacks.
- Leprechauns could spawn with potions of booze (always for individual
  leprechauns, low percentage chance in leprechaun halls). Ideally, the potion
  should be green.
- When random gold piles generate, leprechauns should frequently spawn on them.
- Random gems should have an elevated frequency of emeralds and green worthless
  glass.
- If the game is started on St. Patrick's Day, the potion of booze is always
  shuffled such that it's green.
