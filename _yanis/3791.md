A SpliceHack spell to make splatters of blood have a use case. It causes blood
splatters in a area scaling from 3x3 to 7x7 around the caster (depending on
skill) explode, dealing physical damage to things caught in the explosions.
Blood splatters on the floor are cleared, and new blood being caused by
something dying might be suppressed if it becomes too easy to repeatedly cast
this for lots of explosions.

As proposed, this would be a level 5 attack or matter spell.
