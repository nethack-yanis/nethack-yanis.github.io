Artifact shuriken *The Silver Star*: deals +d8 damage to all targets. Like Mjollnir, it returns to the player's inventory after being thrown, but doesn't have any chance of hitting the player. Since there is only one of it, it cannot be multishot.

This would be a good first sacrifice gift for Monks.
