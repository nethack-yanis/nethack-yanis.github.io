Have all the demon lords fightable in Gehennom, but none of them are required to
win the game. The incentive for defeating them is that they each apply a unique,
harsh debuff or other thing to make the hero's life harder that kicks in on the
ascension run. If the demon lord is killed, the effect goes away.

Effects could include:
* The mysterious force, as it exists in vanilla.
* Hordes of q generate and rampage periodically. (This would be for Geryon).
* When you try to ascend the stairs, they vanish and several illusory copies of
  stairs appear across the level, along with one real one which you have to
  find.
