Artifact helm of telepathy, neutral aligned, that either enhances or blocks
telepathy level-wide based on whether you have it from some source other than
the helm (or alternatively, it's not a helm of telepathy, and just bases things
on whether you are telepathic), and grants a Charisma-based bonus to your armor
class.

If you do have telepathy, all other monsters get telepathy too and you can sense
them, and they will be affected by telepathy-targeting effects, including yours
if you have any psionic abilities.

If you don't have telepathy, all other monsters will be treated as if they are
not telepathic, even if they are; they will also be blocked from using any mind
blasts or other psychic powers.
