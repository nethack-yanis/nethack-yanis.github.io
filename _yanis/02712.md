Levitation from a blessed potion or an artifact allows you to use &lt; and &gt; to float into the air and descend at will, without the levitation timing out. This would require implementing two additional flags: one that tracks whether your levitation comes from those sources, and one that tracks whether levitation is currently suppressed due to your voluntary descending.
