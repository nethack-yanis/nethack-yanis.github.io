Rather than having dragonhide items be generically "dragonhide", let them each
be a certain dragon color, which cannot be specified by wishing. This item does
not confer the same extrinsic it would if it were body armor. Instead, when you
are wearing dragon scales or mail and a dragonhide item of the same color in
another slot, you gain a very powerful extrinsic which cannot be gained
otherwise. E.g. cancellation immunity for gray dragon armor.

The idea is to discourage everyone continuing to wear gray or silver dragon
scale mail: if you find or wish for dragonhide gear and get some other color,
it may be attractive to wear dragon scale mail of that color instead in order to
get the powerful extrinsic.
