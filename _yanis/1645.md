Fire/flame nymph, a red <span class="nhsym clr-red">n</span>, which normally only spawn in Gehennom (or possibly near lava not in Gehennom) and are noticeably stronger than other nymphs. Have two steal attacks which burn any items stolen, and also a fire attack. Potentially a passive fire attack as well. They also explode into fire when killed.
