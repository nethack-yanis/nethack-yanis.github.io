Bag of homogenization, a magical bag that will convert the material of items
placed into it to match the material of a stack of the same object type in the
bag, if one exists, so that they can stack together. If this is unbalanced, or
it's desired to make it facilitate stacking even more, it can also remove
enchantment and fooproofing from the items placed into it.
