When a god smites you, the pool of possible smites should vary according to the
god's alignment. Some examples:
- Chaotic god: melts your flesh with acid.
- Lawful god: blinds you with light.
- Lawful god: your armor gets turned white and cancelled, possibly made
  nonmagical.
- Chaotic god: they send an avatar to "seduce" you (unresistably), injuring your
  legs for several hundred turns.
