Geckos and spiders should be capable of clinging to ceilings, since they can do
this in real life. Spiders, in particular, should prefer a strategy of spinning
a web and waiting on the nearby ceiling (possibly hiding on the ceiling, though
that probably isn't feasible for giant spiders) rather than roaming around.
