Soul selling: when you summon a demon lord, there is some opportunity for you to sell your soul to them in exchange for a wish.
* Selling your soul both angers your god and suppresses all interaction with them.
* You may be able to recover your soul by killing the demon lord; for balance the demon lord should go far away when you sell your soul, though not out of the game.
* Alternatively, unless you wish for nothing (which makes the demon lord vanish forever), the demon lord will immediately become hostile, making it an unlikely tactic in the early game.
* Entering a temple without your soul will immediately anger the priest.
* Your quest leader won't let you go on the quest while you are soulless.
