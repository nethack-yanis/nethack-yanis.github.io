While wielding a polearm and attempting to move in a direction where there is a monster 2 spaces away (and no monster 1 space away), attack with the polearm instead of moving. Also attempt an attack for monsters 2 spaces away diagonally if polearms are Expert. To hit a monster a knight's move away, it still has to be applied. If preceded by the m key prefix, move into the space normally and don't try to attack.
