You can get some rare intrinsics by eating artifacts that confer them. For
instance, eating Excalibur could give level-drain resistance, or eating
Grayswandir could give hallucination resistance.

The chance would be much less than 100%, possibly even lower than the standard
odds of getting an intrinsic from eating jewelry.
