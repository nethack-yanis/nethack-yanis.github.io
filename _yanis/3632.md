Leprechauns very rarely drop a four-leaf clover on death. This is a vegan
comestible that provides 1d3 luck (or just acts as a luckstone) when carried and
can be eaten to gain 1 Luck. (The four-leaf clover appearing from sacrifices is
not this item and cannot be picked up, though that could become confusing.)
