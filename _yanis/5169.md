Druids' mistletoe requirement for maintaining good energy regeneration should
scale up as they gain more levels rather than being a fixed amount, because as
soon as you have that fixed amount there's no reason to find any more.

One proposed formula is: energy regeneration is halved if you possess less
mistletoe than your XL, regular if you have mistletoe equal to your XL, and
increased if you have more mistletoe than your XL, possibly with some exception
for very low level Druids.
