Add a way to show nearby unseen pets and possibly also peacefuls. Using a
warning-like system, they render as green 1-5 (pets) and blue 1-5 (peacefuls)
using the same scale as warning does.

Initial idea was to tie this to intrinsic warning or when wearing a blessed ring
of warning, but this has flavor problems since warning exists to alert you to
threats, which pets and peacefuls aren't. Plus, a lot of roles get intrinsic
warning anyway, and rings don't generally change behavior based on beatitude. It
might be better off coming from some other source.
