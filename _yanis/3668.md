The player is able to do some sort of ritual that involves sacrificing 25,000
gold pieces to open a portal to Fort Ludios if one has not already been
generated. Possibly this would have to be done in a vault. If a naturally
generated portal does already exist, the gold is still expended but the attempt
to make another one fails.
