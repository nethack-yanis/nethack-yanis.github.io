Remove fainting and direct starvation as a game mechanic.
* In its place, just permanently and repeatedly decrement the hero's Strength or Constitution while they are in the Starving range (when nutrition &le; 0) until the hero dies from stat loss.
* The reduction happens when you hit -N nutrition, and it gets reset to 0 when this happens.
* Permanent reduction is done by reducing the current ''and highest-reached'' values of the stat by 1, so restore ability won't restore its full previous value.
* Since Fainting was pretty lethal already, the interval between losing points should be pretty short.
* When you eat something, before adding the nutrition from the food, your nutrition resets to 0.
* Sustain ability prevents stat loss but makes you faint instead.
