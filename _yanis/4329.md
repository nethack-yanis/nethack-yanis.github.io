Artifact chaotic helm *Helm of the Underworld*, modeled after Hades' helm.
Grants drain resistance, invisibility, magic resistance, and passive detection
of buried objects (or phasing, if this is too difficult to implement) when
worn. When invoked, it does a stronger version of the chaotic turn undead
effect (rebuke or tame undead).
