Scroll of recall: a scroll that works like a magic whistle but with more varied effects.
* Uncursed: works identically to a magic whistle, summoning pets on the level to your side.
* Blessed: summons pets from anywhere in the dungeon to your side.
* Cursed: summons hostiles to your side (unclear if this is from anywhere in the dungeon or just the current level).
* Confused: summons objects to your side.
