All foocubi should pick up rings of adornment that they happen to find on the
ground. Incubi should be capable of putting on your finger a ring of adornment
*they* are carrying.

When they have a headache, succubi should steal adornment rings and incubi
should put them on your finger, but they will do this "petulantly".
