The monster generation rate in the Quest gets reduced to almost nothing once the nemesis is defeated.

Alternatively, monster spawn rate in the quest is very, very low, and more monsters are generated with the level.

Alteratively alternatively, defeating the nemesis removes the Quest-specific monster generation; newly generated monsters will be random like ones outside of the Quest.
