Revamp Gehennom by making its main branch substantially shorter, a "hub" branch
containing stairs or portals to a bunch of sub-branches containing demon lords'
lairs. Most of the lairs are optional, but at least some of them are required in
order to enter the Sanctum. Each demon lord that you don't kill, however,
incurs passive debuffs on you once you have the Amulet. These debuffs can
include the mysterious force, damage-over-time mechanics, and much more.
Suggested ones include:
* Asmodeus: Some damaging cold effect that happens periodically.
* Baalzebub: Something to do with insects, either periodic summon insects from
  nowhere or stronger/more frequent insects
* Juiblex: You may randomly become ill, or have your regeneration dampened or
  something
