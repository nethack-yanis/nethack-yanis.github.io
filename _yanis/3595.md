In games where Orcish Town generates, Izchak appears on the level above and
wanders around (he will only appear there once the Minetown level generates, so
can't be found earlier). If you talk to him, he will offer a sidequest where
once you slay all the orcs and liberate the town, he will go back there and
reopen his shop, restocking it with items.
