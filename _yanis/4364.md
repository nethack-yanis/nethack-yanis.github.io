Artifact unaligned pair of lenses _The Lens of Truth_ (or _Lenses_ to avoid
oddity), from Zelda, which grants see invisible when worn. Also, while wearing
them, you must tell the truth, which primarily affects interacting with vault
guards and could be implemented as any of the following:
- You will auto-reply to vault guards with your real name rather than being
  given the opportunity to lie.
- You are prompted "Give your name?" so you can remain silent.
- You are penalized for lying, much more harshly than losing an alignment point.
