Cheating in Sokoban no longer affects Luck. Instead, the amount of cheating you do is tracked; the quality of the prize item degrades the more you cheat. So a little bit of cheating might still give you the amulet of reflection, but a moderate amount would turn it into an amulet of ESP, and a lot of cheating would turn it into an amulet of restful sleep or something.
