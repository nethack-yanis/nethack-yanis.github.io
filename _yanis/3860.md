Make #polyself a non-wizard-mode-exclusive command. When used in regular play,
it will:

1. Cast the polymorph spell at yourself, if you know it.
2. Otherwise, attempt to activate a polymorph trap you are standing on.
3. Otherwise, fail like the #teleport command would when you are unable to teleport at will.
