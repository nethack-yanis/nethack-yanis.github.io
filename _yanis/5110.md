Cavemen should be able to see in the dark, because they're accustomed to caves
and are used to darkness.

The gameplay effects of this are: if they're moving around in a darkened area,
they will still accurately see and map all the floor in that area, all the walls
and other terrain at the edge of that area, all the monsters and objects, etc,
but the area won't actually be lit up - floor will still render as dark room.
