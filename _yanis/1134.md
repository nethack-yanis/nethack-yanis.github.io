Shepherds' crooks: a wooden multi-purpose weapon-tool.
* Damage is a little less than a quarterstaff. Should probably not weigh as much as a quarterstaff; it would be hard to justify 40 weight any way you slice it.
* Can be applied to give a menu offering to do one of three things (and unlike grappling hooks it never does the wrong thing):
  1. Hit a monster at polearm range (skill-dependent).
  2. Attempt to hook a monster at polearm range. Tame monsters are always hooked. Peacefuls are always hooked, but may be angered. Hostiles might be hit instead of hooked. If the monster is hooked, it will be pulled towards you, or you will be pulled towards it if it's much larger than you.
  3. Grab the top item from a square, even if the square is a trap or water square.
* Wielding one passively gives a boost to the radius in which pets will follow when you change levels.
* Wielding one also makes pets follow you as if you had a treat.
* Can be applied to a monster two squares away to yank it towards you, which may stun the monster.
* Binders in dNetHack could start with one. Peasants in dNetHack could generate with them.
* Two-weaponing a crook and a flail should do ''something'' (from Egyptian pharaoh iconography).
