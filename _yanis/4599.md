Ancient dragons, if ever implemented, should have gaze and roar attacks. These
were not fully enumerated, but shimmering dragons should have a stunning gaze,
gold should have a blinding gaze, etc.

The roar attacks both add some much needed use to the AT_SCRE attack type and
prevent you from overcoming the ancient dragons' additional threat over regular
dragons with a simple blindfold.
