Spell of necromancy that can animate corpses into tame undead. Probably in the clerical school, though a case could be made for matter. You can only create undead if it's a suitable monster (i.e. a jackal can't be turned into undead but a gnome can turn into a gnome zombie/mummy). A higher caster level lets you create more powerful undead. At a high enough level, you can create tame ghosts, wraiths, and even shades from the corpses of any intelligent monster. Casting this spell would have some sort of penalty for lawfuls; there would be some sort of warning before trying to cast it.
