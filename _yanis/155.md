The xlogfile should record whether the game was likely a startscum, for analysis
purposes. It's easier for the game to track things like fountain quaffing and
using obvious dangerous items. How exactly this would happen is not determined;
the game probably shouldn't try to make a decision itself, there will be some
false negatives and positives, but storing fields for everything like "number of
times quaffed from a fountain" is probably bad too. Also, if players are aware
of a scum-detecting algorithm, some will deliberately work around it.
