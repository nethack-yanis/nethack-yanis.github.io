You can convince peaceful intelligent monsters to join your cause (taming them) by chatting with them. The outcome depends on several factors: yours and the monster's alignment (lawfuls have a very hard time recruiting chaotic monsters), yours and the monster's level, your Charisma, and possibly others. Failing might turn the monster hostile, or do nothing (but you can't try again). More complex behavior could possibly be implemented with the monster demanding something from you or making you do something. Also, give bonuses if the monster you are trying to convince is of your own race.
