A game mode that allows you to keep playing after death. There are two ways this
could go:

* Continue playing as the monster who killed you. This game mode would likely be
  non-scoring, and your actual character's death would be written out in the
  normal manner.
* Continue playing as your own corpse. In this mode, you are effectively a
  blind, deaf, and sessile monster who can take no actions other than resting.
  The game finally ends when your corpse rots away. This is mainly interesting
  combined with an implementation where allies can zap your corpse with undead
  turning to resurrect you; if they do so before you rot away, then you can keep
  playing. It's not clear what would happen if you are petrified instead; a
  statue can survive indefinitely, and the odds of a pet being able to
  stone-to-flesh your statue are low but not zero, so possibly the criteria
  should instead be "you die when there are no more pets on the level". This
  still has a problem in that some pets could survive indefinitely, though.
