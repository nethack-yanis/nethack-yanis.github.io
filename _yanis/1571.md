Merge magic cancellation and monster magic resistance into a single stat "magical protection" which determines how easy it is for the magical portion of attacks to reach you and deal effects. All races have a low innate MP, but armor can raise it higher. Most monsters' innate MP resembles their current monster magic resistance.
