A monster with a wand (or wand-like attack that requires being lined up with it)
that always kills you - no matter what extrinsics or intrinsics you have, like a
souped-up wand of death - but cannot or will not use it until you have seen it
for a turn, to make it not an unavoidable instadeath.

Orcus is a possible candidate for this, if his wand of death is either turned
into a special "Wand of Orcus" artifact or it's just more powerful when he's the
one zapping it.
