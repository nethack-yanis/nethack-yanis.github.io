Wands of wishing always start at 0:1, but now uses the standard recharge and
explosion odds of normal wands: it can be recharged multiple times with an
increasing chance of exploding, rather than allowing only one recharge and
always exploding on the second recharge. Recharging a wand of wishing only
gives it 1 charge back, regardless of whether blessed or uncursed charging was
used.

The practical effect is that it becomes an interesting choice for the player
whether they should wrest the wand when it is x:0 (which gives 1 more wish
guaranteed, but that's it) or risk recharging the wand (with its standard
increasing chance of exploding, so it could either give no more wishes at all
or give 1 plus the same choice of whether to recharge again.)
