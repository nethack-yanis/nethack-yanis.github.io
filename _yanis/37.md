Asmodeus and Baalzebub should demand gold proportional to their difficulty or
monster level, not the player's wallet. Possibly, if the player does not pay,
they should remain on the downstairs and will not move until the player has
paid, which allows the player to return with the requisite amount of gold (and
may charge interest for the time you spent keeping them waiting). However, they
will get angry if you get below their lair in any way (possibly measured by
testing your lowest level reached each time you enter the lair).
