Asmodeus and Baalzebub demand gold proportional to their difficulty or monster level, not the player's wallet. Possibly, if the player does not pay, they remain on the downstairs and will not move until the player has paid, which allows the player to return with the requisite amount of gold. However, they will get angry if you get below their lair in any way (possibly measured by testing your lowest level reached each time you enter the lair).
