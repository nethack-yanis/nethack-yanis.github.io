In variants that have vulnerability to elements, especially as a temporary
debuff that the player can be inflicted with, you should be able to remove the
debuff by doing something that would give you intrinsic resistance to that
element (such as eating a corpse or tin).

Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that you should be able to stack
multiple sources of the resistance to negate or reduce the severity of the
vulnerability - i.e. two extrinsic sources of the resistance, or intrinsic
resistance paired with an extrinsic.
