You can quaff an adjacent water elemental, giving you a YAFM ("The water
elemental looks deeply offended.") and angering it if it was peaceful. Drinking
it does not have any effect on you, but deals 1 HP damage to the elemental,
killing it if it was at 1 HP ("As you drink the water elemental, it
disintegrates into droplets.")

You can also dip potions into a water elemental to dilute them, which also
produces the offended message and angers it, but does not do any potion effect
or damage to it.
