Mind flayers have to grapple your head before they can successfully suck your brain (like in D&D), forcing them to spend a turn doing this. If you have a greased helm, this gives you at least one extra turn to act since they will not be able to grapple your head until the grease dissolves.

This would probably best be implemented by giving them a sticky grab attack and ignoring the existence of their tentacle attack if they aren't already grappling you (or you are being held by another enemy and thus can't avoid them).

In variants that implement zombies eating your brain, it should work on basically this same system, where the zombie needs to hold onto you before it can eat your brain (and which also works that way in D&D).
