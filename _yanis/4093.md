Add a bit to the monst struct that tracks whether the monster is hiding on the
ceiling or not. (Only valid for things like wumpuses, piercers, and perhaps bats
but not actually since bats don't roost on the ceiling when inactive.)

Then, when polymorphed into a wumpus or piercer, you can use < when not on
stairs to climb onto the ceiling and > to climb back onto the floor, but only
when adjacent to a wall.
