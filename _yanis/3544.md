Djinn role: the primary gimmick of it is that you are able to access three
wishes, through #invoke or some other mechanism, one each at experience levels
10, 20, and 30. You are not able to get wishes from any other source; the wish
fails (perhaps a friendly djinni from a lamp will make some comment about how
you don't need more wishes or they can't grant wishes to fellow djinni).
