A game mode that makes you play a Wizard and guarantees you start with a
"polyrunner" kit - wand and ring of polymorph and ring of polymorph control.
(Maybe also potions of polymorph). This can be startscummed for, but of course
takes many games to get this exact kit, so the game mode circumvents this. To
balance it out, random objects don't generate, or generate at a very reduced
rate.
