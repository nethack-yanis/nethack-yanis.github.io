New monster "aballin", from D&D. It is a mobile j-class monster that can appear
as a pool of water when not actively moving, and can possibly appear as a water
elemental when moving. They can eat organic items like gelatinous cubes, though
perhaps not instantly like gelatinous cubes, instead dissolving them some time
after engulfing them. They are incapable of climbing stairs, and typically sit
dormant imitating a pool until a monster draws near, at which point they become
active.
