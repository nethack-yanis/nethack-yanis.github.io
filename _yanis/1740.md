Change how drowning attacks work, by making them pull you into a water square that is adjacent to both you and the attacker, and then sticking to you so you can't move out of the water. This requires that the hero be allowed to survive (with a suffocation timer) underwater for several turns without magical breathing. If there are no mutually adjacent water squares, the attacker can't use their drowning attack (it would either do nothing or you'd still be held but not get pulled anywhere). Unlike regular drowning, this wets your items each turn.
