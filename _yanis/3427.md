If you trigger a rolling boulder trap for which a boulder didn't generate
because there was no room to put it, a boulder may fall out of the ceiling
instead (and the trap is removed) similar to a cursed scroll of earth. On
early levels, it doesn't have to fall on the same square as the trap.

Also, rolling boulder traps (beyond early levels) that do find appropriate
launch locations may generate with no preexisting boulder on one of those
positions. When triggering the trap for the first time, a boulder drops out of
the ceiling on one of the launch positions and then begins rolling across the
trap.
