Certain monsters with heavy tails (possibly defined as all slithy monsters, but
there could be non-slithy monsters as well) can use tail slam attacks. This
could be implemented as a new attack type, but more likely should just be
implemented with the regular AT_KICK attack with the messages changed to reflect
the tail doing it.
