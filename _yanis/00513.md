New unaligned artifact dagger ''Almagest'': uses the powers of scrolls to augment itself, and bears a scroll label signifying which scroll ability it is imbued with. Opinions vary on whether this label should be randomly generated by the dagger (and the player may choose to read it, upon which it gives the uncursed scroll effect and disappears for 1000 turns, eventually returning with another label) or whether the label should be deliberately imbued by the player by #rubbing it on a scroll. It gains +d4 to damage and +d4 to hit when it has an inscription.

There are additional special effects if the player has formally IDed the scroll:
* Identify: 25% chance of probing
* Light: +d6 to undead, light source
* Enchant weapon: +d4 damage
* Enchant armor: gives 3 points of AC when wielded
* Remove curse: Protects fully from all curses when wielded
* Confuse monster: 25% chance to confuse
* Destroy armor: Ignores enemy armor when calculating to-hit
* Fire: +d8 fire damage
* Food detection: Enemies are much more likely to leave corpses
* Gold detection: Enemies may drop small amounts of gold when killed
* Magic mapping: 5% chance of activating clairvoyance on hit
* Scare monster: 15% chance to scare on hit
* Teleportation: 10% chance to randomly teleport on hit
* Amnesia: Extra mindflayer tentacle attack, no effect when read
* Create monster: 5% chance for create familiar effect on hit
* Earth: 5% chance to create boulder over enemy
* Taming: 5% chance of charm monster effect on hit
* Charging: Does 2x Pw damage and adds it to your own, 5% chance of cancellation
* Genocide: Instakills as Tsurugi, +1 damage
* Stinking cloud: Permanently poisoned
* Punishment: Weighs 100, deals +d12 damage. Autocurses and triples alignment losses.
