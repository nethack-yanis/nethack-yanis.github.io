Deeper in the dungeon, rust traps might target your pack instead of your armor
or gear, and could possibly be renamed to "water trap". On deeper levels and
particularly in Gehennom, rust traps phase out to be replaced by acid traps.
These deal corrosion and acid damage (and quite a bit of it, like having
multiple potions of acid dumped on your head).
