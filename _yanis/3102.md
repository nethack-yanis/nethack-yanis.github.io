Scale the damage from an anti-magic field (caused by having MR so you don't get drained of magic power) to your maximum HP, or possibly by your experience level, rather than a few d4s that are usually meaningless to any character with a few levels. Or have it be based on your Pw maximum, with a higher maximum incurring a larger amount of HP damage.
