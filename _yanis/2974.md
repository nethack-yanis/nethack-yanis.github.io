New artifact *The Never-Ending Doughnut*, an unspecified-comestible base type artifact that can only be eaten when Hungry or worse, but will never get fully consumed unless the eater is a purple worm. After eating it the first time, it is perpetually "partly eaten". You cannot become satiated by eating it.
