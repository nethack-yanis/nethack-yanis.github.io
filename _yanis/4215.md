Wizards can talk to the apprentices in their Quest home level to pay them for
learning (possibly only low-level) spells. These are provisionally priced at 50
times the spell level times the player's level, and is intended to serve as a
dilemma for whether to buy spells or protection. (However, a single point of
protection would cost the same as 8 total levels of spells, so the cost may need
to be raised.)
