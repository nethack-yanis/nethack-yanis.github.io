When your god decides to gift a non-artifact, they should actively avoid gifting
any object type the player is already carrying in their inventory or, even more
in depth, in any containers in their inventory. Though this raises the
possibility of abuse (carrying lots of different candidate gear to
make the god pick something else) and the possibility that a player will be
sacrificing and hoping to get a certain thing, not remembering that they do
already have one of that so they will never get gifted it.
