In variants with the Wands Balance Patch, or otherwise have multiple levels of lightning power (Skilled lightning spell or something), lightning should chain into other monsters near the first thing it hits. Chain lightning can still be reflected. The jumps are made in random directions, so hitting a monster close to you may cause it to chain back into you.
