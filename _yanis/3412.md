Reduce the spell level of magic mapping, but also reduce its utility: instead of
mapping the entire level at once, you choose a point to center your divination
on and a circular or square area, with a radius dependent on your divination
skill, gets mapped. After this change, it might be similar enough to
clairvoyance to be merged with that spell (the difference with clairvoyance is
that it currently always centers on the player; perhaps the new merged spell
could instead scale with skill by having a fixed mapping area, but the distance
you can target it at increases with skill level.)

This does not change the scroll of magic mapping behavior, which still maps the
whole level.
