Scrolls of enchant armor should prompt the player to choose a piece of armor to
enchant rather than picking randomly, since in nearly all cases they are used on
a single specific piece of armor by removing all other armor anyway. It should
also say "This is an enchant armor scroll." and auto-identify itself if not
previously identified.
