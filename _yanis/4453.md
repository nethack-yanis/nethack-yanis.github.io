Convert the sleeping gas trap to just "gas trap", and make it scale based on
the difficulty. Each individual trap releases a single type of gas; which type
is partially dependent on the level difficulty. At low levels, they all emit
sleeping gas like normal. At higher levels, they emit stunning hallucination
gas like container traps, clouds of poison gas, and maybe even nastier gases
that reduce speed or miasmas that cause illness.
