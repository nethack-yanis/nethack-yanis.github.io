A boss that, when first angered, takes no moves for 10 turns, and is
invulnerable, though any damage you decide to do to it is tracked. After the 10
turns expire, the boss is given a HP maximum and other stats directly
proportional to how much damage you did while it was invulnerable. If you kill
it, it gives rewards also proportional to this amount of damage.
