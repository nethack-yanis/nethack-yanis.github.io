A monster that's an evil blacksmith (cyclops?) with a special attack that
applies harmful object properties to your equipment. They may also do this to
items they find while roaming around the level, but leaving them on the floor
rather than picking them up so it looks like nothing has been done to them.

Applying a negative object property could also be a monster spell, but this may
not work as well as long as all arcane spellcasters use the same spell list; it
would probably result in this effect being too abundant.
