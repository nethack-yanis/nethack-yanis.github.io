Set the upper bound for the upper limit of nurse dancing at 3 times the amount
of maximum HP you had when you first gained your current experience level (which
is saved by the game in versions 3.6 and later), instead of having it be a flat
25 times your experience level. This is to remove the rubber-band effect where
roles that naturally have less HP can mostly catch up to roles that have a lot
of it.
