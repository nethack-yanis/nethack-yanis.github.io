Allow some Gehennom filler levels to be non-persistent in a limited manner. They
will generate new maps and terrain upon being re-entered, but will retain all
the monsters and objects they had, which will be placed in random spots. Since
this compensates for the mysterious force by delaying the ascension run and
offering more time for harassment and monster spawns, remove the mysterious
force as well.
