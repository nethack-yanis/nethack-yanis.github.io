If you have confusion charges from the scroll or spell (meaning your hands are glowing red), the Z menu will gain a "confuse" spell option that always has a 0% failure rate, with the associated key being "-". Casting this allows you to "zap" a confusion charge in any direction, confusing the first monster it touches.
