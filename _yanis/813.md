"Painting" dungeon feature / furniture. Players can look at them to see what it's a painting of, possibly identifying item types they didn't already know about. Could be free-standing (magenta <span class="nhsym clr-magenta">\\</span>) or could be part of the struct rm flags of a wall (magenta <span class="nhsym clr-magenta">|</span>, interactable by farlooking them while adjacent). Might be able to be haunted - can produce a ghost?
