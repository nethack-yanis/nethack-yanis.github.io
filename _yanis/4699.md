An identification-less conduct - you are prohibited from identifying any items.
There are three possible implementations of this, in ascending order of
strictness:

1. The conduct is broken when you use identification magic to fully identify an
   item. This does mean it's a risk to sit on thrones, as the "insight" effect
   may fully identify your inventory without warning. Use-identifying (e.g.
   zapping a wand, seeing a bolt of fire, and learning that all wands of that
   type are wands of fire) is fine.
2. A birth option which shuts off formal identification and use-identification.
   This would likely just create a lot of tedium, though - the player would be
   incentivized to type-name object classes that they know for certain as soon
   as they learn them.
3. A birth option which shuts off formal identification, use-identification, AND
   the discoveries list (so type-naming is not allowed and you always just see
   items as their appearance). This nominally removes the tedium of the above
   approach, but could still result in tedium if the player wants to replicate
   the discoveries list outside the game.
