When a puddle of shallow water is trying to dry up, first check whether it's
part of a larger water body. Do a breadth-first search to find all connected
water terrain and see if it either reaches the edge of the map, or if it
connects up to a certain threshold amount of deep water squares. If either of
these conditions is satisfied, the shallow water never dries up.
