More flavorful messages that get printed when you make a critical hit. Suggested
ones include "You cut off foo's arm!", "You plunge your sword into the heart of
foo!" "You cut off the head of foo!", "You bash foo's skull into pieces with
your weapon!"

There may be some trickiness in implementing these, as most messages assume
something about either the player's weapon or the monster's body.
