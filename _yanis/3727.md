A system for martial arts users in which moving tactically and positioning
yourself translates to combat bonuses. Not a flanking system where you get
better positioned with allies in place, but things like:
* Waiting a turn in place before throwing a punch makes it hit extra hard. (This
  synergizes with e.g. allowing a monster to approach you.)
* Jumping or teleporting around a monster before attacking it delivers an
  extra-powerful blow, with teleporting in particular being a coup de grace.
* Following up a hit with a kick makes it hit harder and/or knock the monster
  back.

The ideal balance to strike is that the game can be played without mastering
this system, but if it is mastered the player becomes very effective in combat.
