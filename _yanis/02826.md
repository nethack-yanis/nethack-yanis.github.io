If you are sufficiently skilled at a ranged weapon you are using (perhaps only Expert), you can shoot at non-tame monsters behind your pets and the ranged attack will pass by your pets without hitting them. (If there is no apparent non-tame monster behind the pets, it could either be assumed that you're trying to hit the pets so the attack would hit them, or more generously it would just continue to pass through them.)
