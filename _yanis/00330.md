Polymorph traps, when they polymorph the player, always choose a form considered to be "playable" - i.e. has hands, or is fast enough to run from threats, or is well-defended enough to sustain damage until transforming back, must have speed > 0 - but you do not re-form with your original HP when your polyform is killed, you merely die.
