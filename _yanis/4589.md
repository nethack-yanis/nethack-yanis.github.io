Force-fighting a monster always suppresses any sort of extra attacks you would
get (whether from polyform, monk kick attacks, etc), and results in a simple
melee attack with your arms or arm-equivalents. This is intended to provide a
simple way to fight cockatrices and other dangerous monsters while giving the
player responsibility over it: they are not coddled with auto-suppressing of
dangerous attacks, but also aren't required to find some alternate way to fight
such monsters. It also resolves the flavor problem of why the hero can't simply
decide not to eat the cockatrice's brain.

This does not define what force-fighting should do if you are in a form that
lacks any claw or weapon attacks.
