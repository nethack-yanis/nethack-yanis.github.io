There is some special message or behavior or feeling you get from your god to
convey "I can give you no more artifacts" after you receive your first
non-artifact gift and there are no artifacts left that they can give you. This
saves you from altar farming indefinitely and waiting for a gift that will never
come because it already randomly generated somewhere. (Granted, exhausting the
artifact gift pool means you have already done quite a lot of altar farming
already.)
