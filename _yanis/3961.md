Special monster AIs/strategies for golems. Likely requiring a general AI
overhaul. The strategy for an individual golem could be selected from a set of
possible directives when the monster is created. They follow this directive
completely and literally, which may result in some interesting behaviors. The
player can #chat to the golem to have it mumble its directive.
* _Kill all humans_ - golem attacks the nearest human(oid) it can find, not
  necessarily the player.
* _Gather gold_ - golem pathfinds to the nearest gold on the level. If that
  happens to be carried by a monster, attack it.
* _Build a castle_ - golem seeks out boulders and tries to pick them up and pile
  them into one small collection of spaces on the level. If you destroy or move
  them, it becomes hostile.
* _Get corpses_ - golem tries to collect corpses, but will not hesitate to make
  more if there aren't any more on the level.
* _Build more of myself_ - golem tries to collect things made out of the
  material it's made of. It attaches these to its body, increasing its HP and
  maximum HP; when its maxHP is high enough, it splits into two golems like a
  blue jelly.
