Two new objects, spiked gauntlets and spiked boots. Both are nonmagical and made
of iron. Spiked gauntlets give a large damage bonus to unarmed combat and also
give more AC than standard gloves. Spiked boots give a large damage bonus to
kick attacks, and allow you to walk on ice without slipping, the same as snow
boots do.
