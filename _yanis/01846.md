Whetstones, imported from SLASH'EM, but with some additional effects:
* Cursed whetstones either weld themselves to your hand or have a chance of breaking a weapon rubbed on them.
* Blessed whetstones can uncurse a cursed weapon rubbed on them, but at the cost of removing the whetstone's blessing.
* Rubbing rocks on a whetstone will break them into slingshot.
