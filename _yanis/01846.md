Whetstones, imported from SLASH'EM, but with some additional effects.
* The behavior from SLASH'EM is that whetstones can be used at a water source to remove rust and negative enchantment from edged weapons and pick-axes.
* Cursed whetstones either weld themselves to your hand or have a chance of breaking a weapon rubbed on them.
* Blessed whetstones can uncurse a cursed weapon rubbed on them, but at the cost of removing the whetstone's blessing.
* If slingshot is implemented, rubbing rocks on a whetstone will break them into slingshot.
