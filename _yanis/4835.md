Chatting to priests should produce a menu of the things they offer in exchange
for donating. The menu clearly shows how much gold is required for each
donation, and indicates ones that are too expensive given how much gold you
currently have. Selecting an option donates that minimum amount.

One reason for doing this is that it's very difficult for an unspoiled player to
learn that you can even buy protection from priests, much less the formula for
how much gold should be donated. This would also enable adding in other
variables beyond simple experience level, which is currently infeasible because
it would make knowing the right amount to donate too complicated.
