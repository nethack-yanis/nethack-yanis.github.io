Non-excessive luck system: start by disentangling luck and religion, and convert rnl checks into other checks. Luck can only be -1, 0, or 1 and can never time out unless a full moon or Friday the 13th ends. Some things can reduce Luck to a base of -1, but nothing can increase it to a base of +1 other than carrying positive luckstones.
