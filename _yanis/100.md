Armor should make use of its corpsenm (monster index) for efficiency and to do
interesting things that are not currently done. For example, this would allow
dragon scales and scale mail to be merged into two items that use the various
dragon monster indexes to figure out its special effects, and it would allow for
fireproof low boots created from polypiling a crocodile corpse to be flavored
differently. In variants where applying dragon properties to other pieces of
armor is being considered or planned, this would provide an easy way to do so.

Also see dtsund's dragon scale mail proposal.
