Merge the clockwork automaton and gnome races: you are a gnome in a clockwork
suit. You are able to leave the suit and wind it up instead of needing to find
other people to do it. However, if the suit gets destroyed in any way, you have
to play the rest of the game as a gnome (which is probably nerfed compared to
the current gnome).
