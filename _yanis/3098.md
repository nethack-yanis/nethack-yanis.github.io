New "doomed" intrinsic, which can be given by late-game things such as demon lords (via something like SpliceHack's dark speech). This intrinsic causes your Luck to be counted as -10 as long as it is active, overriding your actual luck and any luck items you have, and not timing out back to 0, though the intrinsic itself may use a timeout. (It doesn't actually change your Luck stat; just makes things that check Luck return -10. When it wears off your Luck reverts to what it was normally.)
