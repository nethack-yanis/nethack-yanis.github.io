Arch-foocubi which do the same seduction as regular foocubi, but the random number they choose has a higher average than a foocubus' 1-35, so the chance of a bad effect is greater and it's less effective to boost your own stats. Perhaps rnd(35) + 25. They are also more grabby than regular foocubi, and will steal jewelry if you have insufficient gold.
