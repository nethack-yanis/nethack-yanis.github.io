Every floor of the Gnomish Mines should have a small chance of generating a
"mining accident": a smallish area containing scattered rocks and boulders, at
least 1 dwarf corpse with regular starting inventory, and 50% chance each of a
digging tool and a potion of booze. Ideally, this will be near or against a wall
rather than out in the middle of an open area.
