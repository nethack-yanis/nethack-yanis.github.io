Various types of floor traps trigger based on your weight. This makes the trap
more likely to trigger on a heavily armored character or one who has collected a
lot of loot. Would work nicely in the Gnomish Mines, since gnomes are light and
don't tend to carry much stuff. Certain traps could also trigger to a lesser
degree if you weigh enough to trigger it but not a whole ton.
