When the player does something that decreases the tameness of a pet, the amount of decrease should be doubled if the pet is intelligent and "weakly" cross-aligned (either the pet or the player is neutral and the other isn't), and tripled if the pet is intelligent and "strongly" cross-aligned (the pet or player is lawful; the other is chaotic).
