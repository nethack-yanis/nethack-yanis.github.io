On the vibrating square level, there is a small (perhaps 5% or 1%) chance that a
death drop will produce one or a few candle instead of the random item it would
be otherwise, meaning that even if you have used up all the other candles in the
game, you don't have to resort to either wishing or grinding for the much lower
odds of naturally getting candles from a death drop.
