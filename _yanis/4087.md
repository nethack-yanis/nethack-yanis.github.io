Tourists encounter a new shop, a gift shop, on dungeon level 1, possibly built
around the entrance stairs. The gift shop stocks mostly useless items like fake
Amulets of Yendor, juice and candy bars at high markups, plastic figurines of
low-level monsters, and T-shirts (which are much less of a big deal to the
Hawaiian-shirt-wearing tourist).
