In variants where gods give non-artifact gifts for sacrifices: There should be
some sort of scale, or defined thresholds, of the various object properties,
materials, and minimum enchantments available from a non-artifact gift. The idea
is that having them be completely random is too swingy and incentivizes early
altar farming (if you can get an amazing property/material/both off a newt
sacrifice as easily as a minotaur, why not just sacrifice all the newts you
can?) and allows for possibly early-game-breaking gifts.

It's not specified what exactly the scale should be based on - your own
experience level, the monster difficulty of the sacrifice, the level difficulty
or depth of the altar, or something else.
