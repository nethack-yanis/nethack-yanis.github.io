Assuming bhaak's bag of tricks proposal is implemented, allowing an bag of tricks to function as a sack: don't destroy the contents when it gets recharged. Instead, just make the contents inaccessible until it becomes empty again. Also, add a possible random effect to using the bag while charged: it spits out one of its contents at random.
