When you are hit by a digestion attack, any corpses you are carrying in open
inventory may be instantly digested by the monster and disappear, or else become
partially eaten. (If the corpse is a cockatrice corpse, it might stone itself,
or maybe that wouldn't happen because of all the stomach acid?)
