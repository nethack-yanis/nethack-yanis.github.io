Piercers can actively perform their falling attack from an adjacent space,
rather than passively waiting for the player to step onto their space. After
falling, they can only make a weak claw attack against the player, and instead
of engaging will try to pathfind to a wall. Once they get adjacent to a wall,
they return to the ceiling and become able to use their falling attack again.

A further change to make them more interesting than just discovering them and
hitting them would be to make them too high to hit in melee while on the
ceiling, unless the player is in a Huge form or larger.
