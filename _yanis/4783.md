In variants that implement object lookup: looking up an object should show that
object's relative probability within its own class.

Statistics that might be more useful to players, but harder to estimate, include
the overall generation percentage for an object per level in each branch and per
deathdrop, and whether or not monsters can generate carrying it. The overall
percentages are tricky because object class distributions vary per branch, and
it's hard to estimate the amount of rooms in a level. Which items generate with
monsters is less tricky but would need significant refactoring to avoid coupling
the object lookup code to the monster generation code.
