Keep a counter on each shopkeeper representing the number of times a pet has
picked up a shop-owned item in their shop (or a shop-owned item inside
containers they are carrying). Every time this increments, use it as an
increasing chance that the shopkeeper will become aggressive towards pets
picking up their wares, with messages like "Kabalebo shouts "Hey! Drop that!"
at Fluffy. Fluffy drops [item]." Once they are past that point, you can't use
pets to take their items anymore.

The point on the counter at which the shopkeeper stops playing nice should be
roughly some fraction of the area of the shop, to strike a balance between large
shopkeepers being more lenient and not allowing you to clean out all the tiny
shops in Minetown. A rumor could be added for this: "They say that mom-and-pop
stores have lower tolerance for thieves."

Unspecified whether the counter should increment when a non-pet picks up an item
in the shop. Probably not, since this is a fairly rare case.
