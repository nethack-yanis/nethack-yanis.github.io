Zapless conduct, which bans any zapping of wands and casting of spells, or more
specifically anything in which you use the 'z' or 'Z' command and don't
immediately decline to select a wand or spell. Cursed wands exploding, selecting
a directional or spell to zap then escaping out of the direction prompt ("The
wand glows then fades" / "The magical energy is released"), or casting a
forgotten spell to become confused all break the conduct. The feedback in
#conduct is "You have never attempted to zap a wand or cast a spell."

The intent of the conduct is to create a game without magic that can be used
repeatedly or spammed. There is one important repeatable use of magic via wands
that is *not* covered above: engraving with wands, which allows using all the
charges in nondirectional wands and burning or carving Elbereth in the ground.
In particular, banning wand engraving would mean a follower of the conduct
cannot use wands of wishing. If the implementation of the game does not already
have an Elberethless conduct, banning wand engraving could be a good addition to
this conduct.
