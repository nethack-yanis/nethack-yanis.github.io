A containerless conduct, which prohibits you from applying containers in
inventory and picking up containers not in inventory.

It does *not* prohibit merely having a container in inventory (which would make
Rogues and Archeologists break the conduct immediately), nor does it prohibit
looting containers you find in the dungeon. The point of the conduct is to play
without being able to ever have more than 52 non-loadstone items at one time,
protect your carried items from elemental or water damage, or get weight
reduction from a bag of holding. Allowing looting of containers means that
players don't have to resort to bad workarounds for random chests such as
locking and bashing them until they break apart.

Heroes that start with sacks still get a small benefit from them, in that they
can choose where to place a container as an early stash and put items into it
rather than leaving them in piles on the ground.

The feedback in #conduct is "You have never picked up nor applied a container."
