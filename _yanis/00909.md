Conflictless conduct: never have a monster attack another monster while influenced by conflict. Would be best if you can safely ring-test conflict, perhaps it gives some message like "You feel aggravation" or "You feel irate" when wearing it (these messages would be shared with the ring of aggravate monster so as not to be unambiguous).
