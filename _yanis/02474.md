Before you have u.uevent.gehennom set, demons and undead (chosen from the graveyard monster algorithm) continually spawn in the maze on the right of the Castle and try to path towards the upstairs. Also before it is set, in the Valley, awake demons and undead will try to path to the upstairs if they have nothing better to do.
