If a digesting engulfer eats an e monster that explodes (either actively or upon
death) or potentially any monster with an explosion attack, the monster is
assumed to explode inside the engulfer, who takes double damage from that
attack and is stunned and immobilized for a few turns, unless they resisted the
explosion's damage type in which case they only suffer that for 1 turn.
