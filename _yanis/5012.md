Dungeon levels should "restock" when you're not on them. During the process of
arriving on a previously visited level, the game should check to see if you've
been gone a long time, and spawn monsters in if so, adding more the longer it's
been (but with some sort of limit so the level can't become crammed full of
monsters).
