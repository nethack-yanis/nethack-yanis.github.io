Cavemen being illiterate makes a lot of sense, but _forcing_ them to be
illiterate is unlikely to make them fun to play when they're already one of the
least fun roles to play. So instead, the role should have mechanics that make
them compatible with illiterate and a good choice if one is trying to win an
illiterate game in particular. But they can also be prodded towards being
illiterate by having them abuse alignment every time they read something
(possibly only scrolls and books, not things like fortune cookies).
