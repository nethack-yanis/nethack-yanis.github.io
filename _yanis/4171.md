If you use #force when standing next to a closed door that you don't know to be
unlocked, the game will ask if you want to force the lock. If you say yes, you
try to; if the door is actually unlocked, you'll get a message indicating that
and "You decide not to force the issue." If it's locked, you try to force the
door with your weapon, which could involve prying with a bladed weapon (opens
the door quietly and faster than kicking, but higher chance of breaking the
weapon than forcing a container would) or bashing with a blunt weapon (much the
same as kicking).
