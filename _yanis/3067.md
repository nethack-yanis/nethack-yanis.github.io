Expand the behavior of the 'unpaid' object flag so that it tracks items that you have stolen from shops or looted from shops with the shopkeeper absent. Unpaid items outside their shop can render as "stolen" in the object name, and attempting to sell them inside a shop will just cause the shopkeeper to claim it and give you no money.
