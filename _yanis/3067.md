Expand the behavior of the 'unpaid' object flag so that it tracks items that you
have stolen from shops or looted from shops with the shopkeeper absent or had a
pet steal. Unpaid items outside their shop can render as "stolen" in the object
name, and attempting to sell them inside a shop (even if not the same one it was
stolen from) will just cause the shopkeeper to claim it and give you no money.
