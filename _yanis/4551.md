Expose some additional information to Lua special level files in order to let
level designers put sanity checks and impossibles into their code which won't be
hit in the course of "normal" gameplay. This could be any combination of the
following:
* `nh.is_sanity_check_on()`, which exposes the sanity_check flag.
* `nh.in_wizard_mode()`, which is true if the game is in wizard mode and is
  therefore being debugged.
* `nh.devel_status()` which returns a string version of NH_DEVEL_STATUS -
  "released", "beta", "work-in-progress", etc.
* `nh.iflags("xyz")` which returns the value of the boolean "xyz" in iflags;
  especially useful for the `debug_fuzzer` flag.
