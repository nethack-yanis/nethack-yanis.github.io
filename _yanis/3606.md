Minesweeper implemented as a themed room: a certain fraction of spaces (probably
10% or less) have a land mine placed on them. Every space adjacent to a land
mine bears an engraving of the number of adjacent mines; mines themselves are
engraved with "X" or "BOOM". Spaces with no mines adjacent have no engraving.
