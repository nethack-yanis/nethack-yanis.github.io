Scroll of repair: uncursed repairs all levels of erosion on an item of the player's choice; a blessed scroll repairs all erosion in the player's inventory; cursed scroll attempts to erode one random item in inventory 1d3 times. If confused and non-cursed, will erosionproof an item of the player's choice; if confused and cursed, will remove erosionproofing from a random item and then erode it 1d3 times.

The scroll of enchant weapon retains its confused effect of erosionproofing a weapon, but it no longer erosionproofs non-weapons or repairs the weapon. Enchant weapon scrolls are also made much less common, with the probability dumped into the scroll of repair instead.
