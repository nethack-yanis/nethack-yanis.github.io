Ovens, a dungeon feature (<span class="nhsym clr-orange">\\</span>) that you can use to cook food, light items on fire, and test potions in a safe, controlled manner like you can with rings and sinks. This happens by putting the potion in the oven and it produces some cosmetic message that can be used to identify it.
