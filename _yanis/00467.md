Elementals fire back weapons you throw at them with additional force (so, usually, additional damage): water elementals in a geyser, fire elementals burning with primal flame, air elementals in a gust, earth elementals in a shower of rocks (or they just incorporate the weapon into themself and become stronger, dropping it on death).
