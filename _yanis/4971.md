Huge and Gigantic monsters should be able to travel more than one space per
action during their turn. Rather than basing it entirely on monster size though,
there should be a "long strides" permonst flag, applied to monsters with legs
such as giants. Only monsters with this flag would be able to travel extra
spaces.
