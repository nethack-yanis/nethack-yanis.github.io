When you hallucinate, you see phantom enemies that aren't really there. They may or may not appear to move, but don't actually exist and will disappear if interacted with.

One way to do this could be to make invisible <span class="nhsym clr-white">I</span> monster symbols affected by hallucination, and randomly place them around the player when they hallucinate.
