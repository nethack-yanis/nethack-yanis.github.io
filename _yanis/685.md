Proposed nerfs for ring and wand destruction due to electric damage:
* Rings never explode, as they are rarer and a more crucial part of a player's gear. Only wands explode.
* Wands and rings made of metal never explode.
* The amount of wands and rings that can be destroyed by a single shock attack has a much smaller cap than it does now.
* Extrinsic shock resistance (and only extrinsic) protects against these effects completely.
* Wands and rings hit by electricity act similarly to being charged, though they don't actually get charged. Wands have their recharge counter incremented then roll for explosion. Chargeable rings roll for explosion at their current enchantment (meaning +0 rings will be safe). Not specified what should happen to unchargeable rings; perhaps they should just behave like +2 rings or something.
