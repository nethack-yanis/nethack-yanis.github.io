Stealing gloves. 0 base AC, and Rogues begin the game wearing a pair. When you hit a monster barehanded while wearing them, you deal no damage (and don't train bare handed combat skill) but you get a Dex-versus-monster-AC chance to steal a random non-equipped item or some gold out of their inventory. You can also attack a peaceful monster with them to attempt to steal something; in addition to the Dex-vs-AC roll, this requires passing both a Dex check and a Cha check for them not to notice. If the Dex check fails, you don't steal anything successfully; if the Cha check fails, they notice (waking up if asleep) and get mad. If the stolen item is currently equipped, there's no Cha check; the monster just gets alerted and angry.
