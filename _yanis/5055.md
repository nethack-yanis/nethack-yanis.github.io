When your only reflection source is silver dragon scale mail, the fire beam is
passing through the cloak slot, reflecting from your body armor, and passing
back through the cloak slot again, so having reflection should not protect your
cloak from being burnt, and in fact it should get 2 chances to burn the cloak.
