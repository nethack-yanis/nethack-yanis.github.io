A fleshed out chat system that would allow you to do lots of things like trade peacefuls for items, pacify and possibly even tame intelligent monsters. Intended for some future taciturn conduct, which first requires there to be actual reasons not to be taciturn. Certain monsters may also dispense random rumors as gossip.
* And with such a taciturn conduct, change messages like "You scream in agony as your body begins to warp" to YAFMs if you have kept the conduct.
