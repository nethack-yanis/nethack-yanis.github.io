Rather than giving each demon lord a fixed weapon with a fixed set of artifact
effects or object property, create a set of powerful weapons that each demon
lord randomly gets one from when they generate.

This might not apply if a demon lord has a strong lore reason for a specific
weapon, such as Yeenoghu wielding a flail.
