When you sacrifice and your god decides to give you a gift, they should take
into account how high-level and in favor with them you are, and if you're
sufficiently beloved, they may offer you your choice of multiple artifacts in
a menu. How beloved you are dictates how many artifacts will be randomly drawn
from the pool of artifacts they could give you at that time, possibly up to a
maximum of 4.

When this number is 1, or if you are receiving a designated first sacrifice
gift, the god just gifts you the artifact normally.

It's unspecified if you should be given the option to decline getting any
artifact at all.

This change is intended to cut down sharply on altar farming in the hopes of
getting a certain artifact, presuming that if the hero can farm for one
artifact they can probably farm indefinitely until they get the one they want.
