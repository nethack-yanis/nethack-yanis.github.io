You should be able to give a potion of see invisible to a shopkeeper while you
are invisible. They will then quaff it, and stop blocking their shop door.
Depending on implementation, if the shopkeeper's see invisible is temporary and
later times out, once they can no longer see you, they will again block the
door.
