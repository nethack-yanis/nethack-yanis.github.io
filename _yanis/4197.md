Adjust the AC values of dragon scale mail (or possibly, the maximum amount to
which they can be enchanted) to even out their general utility to the player.
Specifically:
* Ones that give powerful extrinsics such as silver and gray should have their
  AC substantially nerfed.
* Really underutilized ones that give redundant common extrinsics such as green
  and orange should have their AC raised.
