Replace the whole speed system with the one from Tales of Maj'Eyal, another
roguelike. This has a strict concept of a "global speed", i.e. a number of
movement points you are given every global turn. Every possible action has an
associated movement point cost, which allows for things like zapping a wand to
take less time and be done more frequently than making a melee attack. This gets
rid of the weird existing system where, in ToME terms, your most recent action
defines how much global speed you get, particularly if riding is involved.

One way to start implementing this is to have all the action functions that
currently return 0 for no time taken or 1 for time taken to instead return a
bitmask of all types of actions taken: "moved", "attacked", "cast a spell", etc.
Then the main loop code that handles these return values deducts movement points
corresponding to the slowest action in this bitmask.
