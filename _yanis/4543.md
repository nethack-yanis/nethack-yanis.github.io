Have a small visual element on the screen like a border or a 2x2 area in the
corner. When NetHack completes a screen redraw or is otherwise ready for input,
update this element with a symbol crawling around the border or bouncing around
the corner to provide a visual indication to the player. This is intended for
laggy connections, so you can tell whether your input was processed or not.
