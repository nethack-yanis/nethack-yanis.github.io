Make enchantments on launchers relevant without making them overpowered by
adding their enchantment to damage (because projectiles already add their
enchantment to damage): the enchantment determines the likelihood of getting +1
to multishot, unaffected by role or skill. This chance is given as either
enchantment/(enchantment + 1), or enchantment/8.

If the enchantment is negative, the same formula is used on the absolute value
of the enchantment to determine if multishot should be _decreased_ by 1. If it
is decreased to 0, you fail to shoot anything and waste your action.
