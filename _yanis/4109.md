Hitting an earth elemental with a stone to flesh spell currently has no
interaction, which is odd. The following possibilities have been proposed:
* It turns into a flesh golem. However, stone to fleshing a stone golem already
  does this, and if earth elementals are loose rock compared to the specifically
  built body of a golem, it doesn't make as much sense.
* It instakills the elemental and turns it into a pile of meatballs. This may be
  a little too cheap.
* As above, but the elemental gets the standard chance to resist.
* It cuts the elemental's HP and max HP and drops some meatballs, but only
  actually kills the elemental if this would bring its HP to zero.
