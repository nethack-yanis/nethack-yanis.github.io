Guarantee a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock to be either generated on one of the
Mines levels above Minetown, or in a shop in Minetown (though part of the
motivation for this idea was guaranteeing a way to get into Orcish Town, and a
pick spawning inside that town doesn't really help much, so maybe it can spawn
near the upstairs.)
