Wearing rings that correspond in appearance to wands double, augment, or
otherwise enhance those wands' effects, including possibly turning a beam into
a cone shaped blast.

This could also extend to drinking potions with matching appearances to worn
rings, such as drinking a ruby or emerald potion while wearing a ruby or emerald
ring.
