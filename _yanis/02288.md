Make the Vibrating Square level into, rather than just another maze level, a level with 3 symmetric 7x5 chambers embedded in the maze, each with four exits, and a smaller 3x3 chamber at the bottom containing the upstairs. In the center of one of the 7x5 rooms is the Vibrating Square. This is intended to be a dark mirror of the Astral Plane.
