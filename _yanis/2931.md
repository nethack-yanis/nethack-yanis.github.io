If you are on a staircase/ladder (maybe a magic portal), your pets will always try to approach you (using the appr = 1 code path in dog_goal). Maybe, to make it a little less obvious have pets approach you (with a less than 100% chance) if you are merely near the stairs, with a diminishing chance of intervening to set appr = 1 the farther away you are.
