If you are attempting to ascend on the altar of a god to whom you permanently
converted alignment, you sense a conflict between that god and your original
god. There is a 1/3 chance that the original god prevails; in this case you feel
their power increase and their voice booms: "You were destined from birth to
deliver the amulet to me!" This forcibly converts you (but not the high altar)
back to your original alignment. You retain the Amulet of Yendor, and now must
make your way to your original god's altar in order to ascend properly.
