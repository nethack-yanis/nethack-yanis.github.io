Add two new magical shields: a shield of drain resistance and a shield of shock
resistance. They are intended to make a sword-and-shield endgame build more
competitive compared to twoweaponing.

Most characteristics of them are unspecified, such as if they should be light or
heavy, bulky, conferring 1 or 2 AC, have randomized appearances, or whether
possibly they should just be added to existing shields rather than making new
object types.
