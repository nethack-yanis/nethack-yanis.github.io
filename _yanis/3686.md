After gifting you an item, your god doesn't give you anything else until you've
used it to their satisfaction. Such as killing a certain amount of monsters with
it if it's a weapon, wearing armor for a certain number of combat turns, and so
forth.

This sacrifices gameplay fun for improved flavor and balance, so tread carefully
if implementing it.
