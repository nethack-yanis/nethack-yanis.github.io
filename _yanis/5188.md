Saddlebags: kind of a fusion between a saddle and a container, which allow you
to transport more items around than you can carry yourself. The saddlebags can
be applied to any pet which can ordinarily be saddled, occupying the same slot.
A pet wearing one can be directionally looted, which moves items in and out of
the container. Possibly, they cannot be used to hold any bulky items, and there
may be a cap on the overall weight they can contain, determined by the pet's
carrying capacity.

Not specified if they contain a saddle as part of the item, enabling you to also
ride your saddled pet while also carrying objects in the saddlebags.
