Archeologists should get a combat bonus for discovering artifacts. Flavored as
studying and learning from the artifact to determine how it does what it does,
either identifying or merely touching an artifact grants them a permanent bonus
in line with whatever the artifact does. For instance, studying Demonbane could
grant an additional d6 of damage to demons throughout the rest of the game. The
less useful an artifact is, the better its bonus could be, in order to make it
so that at least one role is happy about finding them.

(Not all artifacts may have a special permanent effect for Archeologists; in
particular, other roles' quest artifacts and any sort of non-weapon artifacts
probably shouldn't.)
