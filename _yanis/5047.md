Lava demons, which are based on water demons, but are always hostile. Instead of
giving you a wish, they have a nonstandard ranged attack in which they wish for
one of *your* items each time they see you. The wish attempts to pick the
highest-value item out of your inventory.

The intended balance for the sight requirement is that you can sneak up on or
blind them before they can wish for anything, but it's not feasible to hide
around a corner and wait for them to approach, because then they will get more
wishes.
