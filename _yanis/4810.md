Redesign the locate level of the Priest quest by removing the single temple and
huge wall of undead and instead doing it as smaller copies: a complex of
buildings with graveyards blocking the entrance of each, and randomizing the
temple. To prevent the player easily finding out with telepathy where the
correct temple is, either scatter some more hostile priests of Moloch in the
other buildings, or add other peaceful priests of Moloch who are not tending
altars, just milling around in their buildings.
