If you directly steal from a shop, even if you pacify the shopkeeper afterwards, the word goes out and other shopkeepers may then charge you higher markups. (Even if you killed the shopkeeper, but not if you killed them without actually stealing anything - perhaps the Kops are sharing this information around).
