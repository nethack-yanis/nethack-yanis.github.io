Take a page out of Brogue's book for streamlining weapon identification: after a
certain number of attacks, hits, or kills with a weapon, the weapon's
enchantment (but nothing else about it) becomes identified.

Possibly, it could take less time to identify a weapon the higher the absolute
value of the enchantment. It should be pretty easy to tell that a weapon is
*really* bad or good, compared to middling.

Behavior is undefined regarding stacking. E.g. if you drop 9 of your 10 daggers,
use the other one a bunch, and come back to pick up the 9, should they still
stack together? If not, it would make using stackable weapons very annoying.
If you use the one dagger enough to identify it, should the others automatically
become identified? Only if you try to stack them together? Not at all?
