Assuming the fruit type of a tree has been made deterministic rather than random when kicked: farlooking a tree will describe what kind of tree it is, e.g. "apple tree", "banana tree". Fruit trees you have already kicked are described as "bare", e.g. "bare apple tree". Trees that never had any fruit, if implemented, are "maple tree" or "oak tree" or something.
