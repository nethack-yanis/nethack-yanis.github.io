If you kill an enemy on a coaligned altar, you get a small alignment bonus and a
message "Shimmering droplets of blood ascend into the realm of [deity]!" (Not
specified what it should say if the dying monster doesn't have blood.)

If in a variant that has Secespita, making the killing blow with that also
decreases prayer timeout by a few turns.
