Several small spellbook additions:
* The thick spellbook weighs more than other kinds. The thin spellbook weighs less.
* Reading a dusty spellbook has a chance of making you sneeze (if you are in a form with a nose), which wakes up monsters.
* Reading a silvery spellbook as a silver-hater makes you "not able to handle" the book and drop it
