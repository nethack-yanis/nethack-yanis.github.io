There should be more types of skeletal monsters in the game beyond the
one-level-wonder ordinary skeletons (and technically liches). Particularly,
there should be skeleton dragons, whose scale mail makes you inediate (not just
slow digesting).

More types of skeletons appearing in more places would also allow for a "bone"
item to be dropped, which various interesting things could be done with.
