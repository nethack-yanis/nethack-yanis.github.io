Do not make the hitpointbar blink uncontrollably when the hero is at critical
HP. Instead, do one of the following:
- Provide a default status hilite of hitpoints/criticalhp/red&blink in the
  default config file.
- Make a status hilite target of "hitpointbar" that can have its blinking
  configured separately from the HP display.
