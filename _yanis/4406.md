If you are an elf, you can read any object with "runed" in the description
(e.g. elven spears, daggers, bows, and the runed wand). Though, elves will know
the identities of most of these items by default, so they won't appear "runed",
which might defeat the purpose.

In any case, the message should be something relatively inane, like "Made in
[elvish sounding place]".
