Spell of elemental fist: after casting it, your next barehanded melee attack
that connects causes an elemental explosion centered on the target. This could
take over as the special spell for Monks.

Not specified how the element gets chosen, whether there should be multiple
different spells each of a different elemental fist type, or whether it should
use an alternate set of elements (stones/waters/metals/winds/fire like the Monk
rank progression) versus basic NetHack elements like fire, cold, and shock.
