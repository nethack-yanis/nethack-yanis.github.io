There should be shops that generate in Gehennom; they have amazing items, but
only take payment in gems, with better gems buying better items. There are a
couple issues to resolve, though: first, the shopkeeper has to be buffed enough
that you can't just kill them; and second, by Gehennom most randomly generatable
items aren't super useful to the average player.

One way to address the first issue could have these not appear as a traditional
shop, but as some sort of wandering peaceful demon species (or randomly peaceful
members of existing demon species), each of who offers a single item in exchange
for a set list of gems. When paid, they summon the item out of a globe of
darkness, so they can't be killed to get it for free. If you decline the offer,
they will turn hostile.

The second issue could be addressed by any of the following methods:
  - Sell a limited set of items known to be useful in the endgame such as full
    healing and gain level potions, genocide scrolls, magic markers, etc.
  - Sell items that are highly unlikely to be generated other than via a wish,
    such as figurines of high-level monsters.
  - Create entirely new powerful items, which can only be purchased from those
    shops and cannot be wished for.
