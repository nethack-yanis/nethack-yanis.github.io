Ideas around a system in which you can cook corpses:
* The general idea is to unbreak the hunger system by making regular corpses unsafe to eat, so the shortage in resources isn't in food itself but is in safe methods of cooking it.
* Cooking sets a corpse's rot timer to 0, lets them go longer without spoiling, or unspoils them.
* May also remove poison from some kinds of poisonous corpses.
* Cooked corpses are unsuitable for sacrifice and less likely to give intrinsics, or don't at all (because the vitamins are destroyed).
* Can apply wands of fire to cook corpses.
* Or maybe eating raw non-vegetarian corpses is just plain dangerous, causing vomiting or sickness or other bad effects.
* Corpses can be cooked by killing monsters with fire or hitting monsters with fire attacks while they are carrying corpses.
* The problem is that nobody has yet proposed a mechanism for cooking corpses that would work well. Having firewood or some similar thing would massively affect the early game between characters that can and cannot manage to find it, and roles that start with or without it. Wands of fire have been proposed as a resource but those are valuable. Introducing a new item like firewood means that a whole lot of mechanics have to be reviewed for whether they should interact with or create that item.
