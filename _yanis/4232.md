Additional YAFMs that may replace the "You hear your heart beat" message for
applying a cursed stethoscope at yourself:
* If hallucinating, "You hear a soothsayer with the weather forecast." This is
  followed by either "Gehennom will get a rain of burning pitch later today." or
  "The dungeon will be cool, with a stony gray overcast."
* Otherwise, if undead, "You hear the ocean's roar."
* Otherwise, if a Wizard, "You hear yourself mumbling curses."
* Otherwise, the usual heartbeat message.
