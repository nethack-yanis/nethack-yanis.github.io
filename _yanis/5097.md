Vorpal Blade should always decapitate Medusa. When this happens, it produces a
"Medusa head" comestible, which is a unique, unwishable item which could either
confer stoning resistance when carried or, like in the myth, be used to stone
monsters at range.

An alternative, to make it more broadly accessible, is to allow any bladed
weapon used in melee to decapitate Medusa, and only her, on a critical hit
(while Vorpal Blade will decapitate on any hit that lands).
