In an effort to reduce the number of low-importance y/n confirmation prompts in
the game, make applying a lock pick or key scan the hero's inventory, the floor
underneath them, and 8 surrounding spaces for doors or containers that the tool
can be used on. If there is only one such thing, automatically use the tool on
that thing without prompting. If there are multiple, either prompt for each one
in sequence or offer a menu of things to use the tool on.

This has a problem in that heroes may end up accidentally locking doors they
want to go through. The problem may not be that important, since they can just
unlock it again. Another suggestion is to make the map symbol for a locked door
different from an unlocked one.
