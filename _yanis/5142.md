Rather than wood materials being described as "wooden" all the time, wooden
objects should have the material adjective randomized among like "oaken,
ashwood, blackthorn", etc, deterministically based on the object ID. The type of
wood does not change anything mechanically about the item, it's purely cosmetic.

If a druid role exists in the game, this should possibly only be shown to them;
all other roles would still just see "wooden".
