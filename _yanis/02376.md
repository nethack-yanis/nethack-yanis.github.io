Engravings are visible from a distance. Instead of the floor rendering as <span class="nhsym clr-gray">.</span> it renders as <span class="nhsym clr-brown">"</span> for dust engraving, <span class="nhsym clr-gray">"</span> for floor engraving, <span class="nhsym clr-black">"</span> for burnt engraving, <span class="nhsym clr-red">"</span> for a message scrawled in blood or marker, and <span class="nhsym clr-green">"</span> for graffiti. Only displays on top of floor spaces; engravings on top of other terrain don't render.
