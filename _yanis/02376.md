Engravings are visible from a distance, having their own glyph which renders only when there is an engraving on top of "uninteresting" terrain (floor or corridor). In ASCII, they render as a ", or possibly a ~, but their color varies based on what type of engraving it is.
* Dust engravings: brown
* Actual engraving (e.g. athame): gray
* Burnt engraving: black
* Scrawl of blood: red
* Graffiti: bright green, bright blue, or bright purple
