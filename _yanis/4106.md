Make the Wizard of Yendor naturally magic-resistant, so that he cannot be
defeated trivially by a death ray, but compensate by removing his Double Trouble
ability. The current state of affairs is somewhat like a lottery in whether you
will be facing him with magic resistance or get unlucky enough for him to
duplicate, leading to a lot of variance in how hard the ascension run is.
