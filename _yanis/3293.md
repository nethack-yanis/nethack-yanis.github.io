Giantslayer gets its bonuses against any monster that is larger than you, rather
than just giants specifically. (Possibly it still gets bonuses against giants
specifically even if you are as big as one.)

Note that dNetHack has a similar feature in which Giantslayer gets bonuses
against any monster that's Huge or Gigantic. It's also been suggested to drop
that to any monster of size Large or larger.
