You can use a wielded saber to parry attacks from other monsters made with
bladed weapons. There are a few proposals for how this would work:
* Reduce the monster's to-hit, so it misses more often.
* On some low percentage of attacks that would hit, negate all damage from the
  attack and produce a message indicating you parried it.
