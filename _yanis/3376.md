If the player permanently converts their alignment, they get Wizard-style
harassment for the rest of the game by their original god. (This stacks with the
Wizard's harassment; after killing the player will begin to be double-harassed.)
The only difference between god and Wizard harassment is that the Wizard won't
spawn. All the other effects remain the same.
