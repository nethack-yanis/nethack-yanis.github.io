Your alignment record should shift over time based on your alignment:
* Chaotics get -1 penalties over time for failing to do any chaotic behavior.
* Neutrals get +1 alignment bonuses more slowly over time by not doing anything.
* Lawfuls get neither of these and need to get their bonuses on their own.
* Alternatively, lawfuls accumulate bonuses by doing nothing (not breaking the
  law).
