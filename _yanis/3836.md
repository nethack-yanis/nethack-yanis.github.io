Some ways to scale some spell effects with skill. Generally, this consists of
nerfing unskilled and basic casting rather than adding even more powerful
high-skill effects.

* Beam spells such as knock and wizard lock scale the range of their beam with
  skill, with only a few squares at Unskilled, up to 4 squares at Basic, up to 6
  at Skilled.
* Identify always identifies exactly 1 item when Unskilled.
* Light scales its radius with skill.
* Charm monster only pacifies 1 monster at Unskilled, and can only tame 1 monster at Basic, 3 at Skilled, no cap at Expert.
