Spell staves are made into poor melee weapons (comparable or worse than the club, being basically a stick that's just sturdy enough not to break), but are made lighter than the quarterstaff, weighing only 10. Its bonus to a single spellcasting school is countered by it applying a slight spellcasting penalty to spells of some or all other schools.
