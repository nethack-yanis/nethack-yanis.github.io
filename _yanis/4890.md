Deaths in Goblin Town should produce a bones file, but one that just consists of
a partial bones pile (not a full pile; the implication is that the Goblin King
removes some of the best items from it) that is supposed to load somewhere in
the early regular dungeon as a warning to other adventurers. These piles should
contain a corpse, but since the former hero did not die on that space, there is
no ghost. The corpse could possibly also uniquely render as "mutilated".
