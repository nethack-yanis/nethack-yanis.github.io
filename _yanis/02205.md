One possible prayer boon is that if you have more than a certain total level/total difficulty of monsters around you relative to your own level, your god will teleport you horizontally somewhere else on the level far from any monsters. If a non-teleport level, they will lift you up one level as a potion of gain level would; if that cannot be done, they will not choose this boon.
