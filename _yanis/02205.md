One possible "trouble" if you are praying is having more than a certain total level/total difficulty of hostile monsters around you relative to your own level. If your god decides you are in trouble from this and decides to fix the trouble, they will teleport you horizontally somewhere else on the level far from any monsters. If the level is non-teleport, they will instead lift you up one level like a potion of gain level would. If that cannot be done, they will not attempt to fix it.
