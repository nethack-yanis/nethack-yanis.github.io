Reading a blessed [[scroll of fire]] allows you to select a spot to center the blast of fire, similar to the selection for a scroll of stinking cloud or the advanced fireball spell. The damage of this scroll is also increased somewhat from what it is now, about four times the current damage, to make it worthwhile to use. ''(This has been added to vanilla 3.6.1 by paxed.)''
