Artifact bronze plate mail *The Pact Eternal*. Autocurses when worn. When
invoked, it summons a tame copy of you, with copies of your armor and wielded
weapon (which only works on a wielded weapon), drains 1 level from you, and
reduces your maximum HP by half.

If you die while the summoned copy lives, you get lifesaved, the max HP penalty
becomes permanent, the copy is unsummoned and you are relocated in its place (to
produce an overall effect of it becoming the "real" you.)

If you take off the armor, the copy is unsummoned.

If the copy dies or gets unsummoned by any means, its gear vanishes along with
it, and your missing max HP is restored (though your current HP does not get
restored).
