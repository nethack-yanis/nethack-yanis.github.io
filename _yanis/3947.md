Allow sinks to be catalysts for alchemizing things. (Or possibly add a
"cauldron" as a new piece of dungeon furniture, but that's iffier.)
* You can dip potions into sinks to pour them down the drain, experiencing the
  vapor effects in a safe way. (Pouring polymorph down the sink of course
  polymorphs the sink.) This requires vapor effects to be implemented for many
  of the potions that don't currently have any.
* If you don't pour the potion down the drain, you instead mix it with the fluid
  from the tap, which is usually water but can already be a random potion.
* Possibly, doing alchemy in/on a sink is more efficient. There are many
  possible forms this could take, such as:
  * Potions not diluting when you mix them.
  * Reduced or zero chance of an alchemic blast.
  * You can get results from mixing potions that you can't otherwise. (Flavor
    for this is weak. Is the character heating them somehow with the hot water?)
