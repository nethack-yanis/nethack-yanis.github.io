A new race whose primary feature is that it eats minerals: gets nutrition mainly
from rocks, may be able to eat metals, and gains limited spell-like abilities
based on the last precious gem they consumed. A couple non-comprehensive
examples:
* Eating a ruby grants the power to cast fireballs.
* Eating a jet stone grants the power to make clouds of darkness.

The abilities could be triggered using #monster, and would probably have a
finite pool of uses, after which they can no longer be used. Eating another gem
before this pool runs out would swap in new abilities and either give a fresh
pool of uses or add to the existing one.
