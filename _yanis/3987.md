Slope terrain, which is a terrain that appears like walls but does not block
line-of-sight. It blocks movement unless levitating or flying, and cannot be dug
down on or into. If you somehow get onto slope terrain (such as by stopping
levitation while on it), you can move off it in any unblocked direction. This
would allow interesting level designs like pyramids and switchbacks. Is still a
bit problematic without implementing actual height values for the terrain, since
for things like a large pyramid, you would be able to see straight over the top
of the pyramid and down the back side.
