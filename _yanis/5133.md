When you get crowned, the crowning artifact already exists, and you are not
indicating you would like a weapon skill unrestricted by wielding an appropriate
weapon, your skill cap in the crowning weapon's skill should be increased by
one, up to Expert. For instance, if you are Lawful but your role normally can
only advance long sword to Basic, you will then be able to advance it to
Skilled.
