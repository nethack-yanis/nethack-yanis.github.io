Portal stones: gray stones which are only useful in pairs (and which only 2 may
generate in the whole game). They are used by putting one stone at a location
you want to return to later, then later on activating the other one by rubbing
it on your hand or something, which opens a temporary magic portal to (or
levelports you to) the first stone.
