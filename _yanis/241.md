Erosion should have more than four states, though it still only displays as
"eroded", "very eroded", or "thoroughly eroded"; different rusting sources can
cause different levels of rust (e.g. dipping a long sword in a fountain or
getting hit by a rust trap would probably only cause a small amount of rust,
whereas a rust monster might cause a lot.) This would enable a more fair way to
have things "erode away completely" like they do in Grunthack, since you would
be able to disengage any thoroughly eroded piece of gear before it was at
serious risk of vanishing.
