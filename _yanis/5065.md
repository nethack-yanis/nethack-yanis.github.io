Vorpal bunny, a magenta <span class="nhsym clr-magenta">r</span> monster with a
deadly bite: it decapitates you if your HP is at 50% or less, and bisects you
otherwise. Probably a reference to the killer rabbit from Monty Python and the
Holy Grail.

It should probably only generate in Gehennom, or be unique and generate in a
specific area or off-branch of Gehennom, or be psuedo-unique by giving it a
birth limit of 1.
