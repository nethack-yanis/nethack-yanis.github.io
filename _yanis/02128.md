Simplified ''Mirror Brand'', based more on dNetHack's mirror blades than its own Mirror Brand. It is an artifact short sword that grants reflection when wielded and when it hits an opponent, takes the higher of its own base damage roll and the other weapon's (then adds its own enchantment to the result).
