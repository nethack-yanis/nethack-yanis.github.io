If you get hit by something reflectable, have no other source of reflection, and prayer timeout is 0, your god may rarely intervene ("But it reflects somehow!"). This could either increase timeout a smallish amount or not increase it. Does not break atheist conduct.

Alternatively, instead of "using" prayer timeout, automatically spend a couple points of divine protection. Because you would have had to break atheist to get that, the atheist problem doesn't apply.
