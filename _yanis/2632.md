Revamp the scroll of scare monster: rather than being good indefinitely as long as it's not picked up, it will increment an internal counter whenever it scares a monster, by an amount equal to that monster's HD or difficulty. The scroll disintegrates on the floor after this "total difficulty of monsters scared" counter exceeds some value.
