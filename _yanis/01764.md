Djinni released from bottles and water demons released from fountains don't care about beatitude or depth for giving a wish; instead they will give the hero a wish if the hero is intimidating enough. "Intimidation" is based on stats like Charisma and XL, and the chance of successfully intimidating them increases as they do. Djinni from lamps are not affected by these rules.
