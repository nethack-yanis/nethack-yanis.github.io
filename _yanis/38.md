Several small spellbook additions:
* The thick spellbook should weigh more than other kinds. The thin spellbook
  should weigh less.
* Reading a dusty spellbook should have a chance of making you sneeze (if you
  are in a breathing form with a nose), which wakes up monsters.
* Reading a silvery spellbook as a silver-hater should make you "not able to
  handle" the book and drop it.
