If you are wielding a spellbook of force bolt, you can attempt to force the lock
on a box with it (flavored as pulling a tiny bit of force power through the
book and into the lock). There are risky side effects to attempting this such as
burning out Pw, a backfire which deals damage, breaking potions, etc.
