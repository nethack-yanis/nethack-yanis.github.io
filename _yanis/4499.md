If the Minetown Watch are hostile and subdue you (reducing you to 0 or low HP,
or possibly only if you chat to them to surrender), they throw you in jail
instead of simply killing you. This probably takes the form of a special jail
level where you start out having regained your HP but have lost most or all of
your possessions. The jail level is staffed with more watchmen (it could also be
guards, but those are specifically guarding vaults).

There could be a variety of ways to escape:
- solving a special puzzle involving moving iron bars or walls and
  levers/buttons
- bribing or seducing the guards
- using stealth to sneak past the guards
- or just waiting a certain amount of time without dying.
