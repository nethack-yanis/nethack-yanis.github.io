Mummies have a constitution-draining touch attack, which possibly also inflicts a 'withering' intrinsic that deals damage over time and abuses Constitution every turn.

Mummies could also "cast" a curse on you, not to curse your items, but to make you sink through the floor, sending you down 1-3 levels.
