A race which is very strong, with great abilities and intrinsics including drain
resistance from XL1, but with the caveat that they instantly die of old age upon
reaching XL30.

Intended for variants whose XP curve doesn't make reaching experience level 30
through pure combat nearly impossible. Also, a safeguard might have to be put in
place so that you cannot intentionally get smited by a god or gamble on
polymorphing into your own race to lose levels intentionally.
