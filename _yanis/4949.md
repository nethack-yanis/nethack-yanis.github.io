The Longbow of Diana should be usable for firing arrows without actually
wielding it, but this reduces the amount of multishot you can get out of it.
This could be flavored as the bow hovering on its own and magically pulling the
arrows from your quiver. The main motivation for this is to bring the Longbow to
parity with throwing darts, which require no launcher.
