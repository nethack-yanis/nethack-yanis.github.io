Portable black hole, a type of bag that automatically destroys any item put into
it (except unique items, which "cannot be confined in such trappings" like any
other container). The intended use is dungeon cleanup - getting rid of altar
farming junk, corpses that will auto-revive, and keeping weapons off the floor
that the player doesn't want to use but doesn't want monsters to get either.
