Monsters that divide/split must find a space adjacent to the splitting monster that is safe for the new monster to be on; if no space exists, the split doesn't happen (and any effects on the monster's current or maximum HP are nullified).

Currently, the split monster lands on the closest available square, which could be not at all close to the original monster in a packed environment, and this is weird.
