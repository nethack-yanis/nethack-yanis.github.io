Vortices, or possibly all whirly monsters, scatter items to different squares when they pass over them (using the throwing code, so items may shatter and creatures may be hit by them). Possibly only objects under a certain weight.

More evilly, they could be able to scatter unequipped items from your inventory when they engulf you.
