Because giving Cavemen a way to get good weapons makes the role less
differentiated, and because the roleplay experience of a Caveman is perceived to
be best when using a club, they should be restricted in nearly all weapons
except for the "caveman basics" such as club, spear, sling, and boomerang.

It might be necessary to make them exempt from getting their skill unrestricted
by their god, because if they could still do that, most players would probably
just use the same old artifacts at Basic skill, again hurting the role's
differentiation.

Forcing them into using primitive weapons might make them interesting by virtue
of incentivizing using attack wands much more to deal with threats; an
interesting gameplay change would be for cavemen to get more uses out of attack
wands than other roles, but that would make little flavor sense.

Of course, this would require their quest artifact to be changed to either a
non-weapon or to one of the types of weapons they are allowed to use.
