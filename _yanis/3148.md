Remove the air currents in Sokoban that prevent you from floating or flying over the pit and hole traps. Instead, apply the normal luck penalty. Though it's been pointed out that this would allow a player to bypass the entire branch and then negate the whole luck penalty if they can find or create a coaligned unicorn and throw a few gems at it.
