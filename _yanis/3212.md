If you pray to your non-starting god while wearing opposite alignment, your original god may try to blast the helm off your head. This can have several possible outcomes:
* Your original god doesn't interfere. The prayer proceeds normally.
* Your original god attempts to remove the helm but fails, possibly causing some HP damage, or uncursing the helm. The prayer then proceeds normally.
* Your original god attempts to remove the helm, fails in one of the ways above, but succeeds at interfering with your prayer, which then fails.
* Your original god succeeds at removing the helm (there are a number of fun ways to do this: they disintegrate it off your head, send it flying in a random direction, teleport it, drop it on the floor, etc.) Your alignment reverts back to its original and the prayer fails.
