Orctown generating should force a temple to be generated somewhere else in the
main dungeon, possibly around level 15. Without this, there is a possibility the
player's first opportunity to buy divine protection will be late in the game at
the Valley of the Dead.

A ramification of this change is that the game would have to know it is
generating Orctown at the beginning of the game, rather than deciding it when
Minetown generates by picking among its variants randomly.
