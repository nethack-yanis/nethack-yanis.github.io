Add a 'configure' shell script in NetHack's root directory, which will send it
through a rudimentary series of prompts about the user's system that will get it
to run the setup.sh script on the correct hints file. This allows NetHack to be
built on unix-like systems from scratch with the conventional "./configure &&
make && make install" command.
