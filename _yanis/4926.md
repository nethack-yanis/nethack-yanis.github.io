It should be possible for Gehennom levels other than the one above the Sanctum
to contain vibrating squares; you would be able to perform the invocation on any
vibrating square, but all it does is give you an alternative route to the level
beneath it. The uinvoked and demigod flags are not set unless you do actually
open the stairs to the Sanctum.
