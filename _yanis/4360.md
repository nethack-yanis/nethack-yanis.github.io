New "flooded stairs" terrain type. They act normally as stairs, but are also
treated as three-dimensional water (that you cannot fly over and must be
submerged in, like on the Plane of Water). This would not be very useful on its
own but would be a building block for quests or other special levels that are
entirely underwater.
