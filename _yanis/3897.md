Potion of coffee, a nonmagical potion which confers some of the following
variously proposed effects:
- Temporary sleep resistance and, while the sleep resistance is still active, a
  small bonus towards the odds of learning a spell from a book successfully.
- A temporary boost to speed and Dexterity.
- Drinking too much coffee in a short time kills you.
