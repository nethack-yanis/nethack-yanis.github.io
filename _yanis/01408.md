God gifts come pre-identified: artifacts automatically become known (so that you get "the Giantslayer" rather than "a long sword named Giantslayer"; non-artifacts automatically become type-identified. At the same time, it may be useful to newer players to not hide the artifact's base type, so perhaps the artifact should not become learned (though identifying its enchantment, etc is still fine).
