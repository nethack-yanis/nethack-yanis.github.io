There should be some additional types of wolves (white wolf, black wolf, giant
wolf, direwolf, maned wolf, etc) added to flesh out the canine monster class,
mainly because in Druid games so many regular wolves will generate that they
go extinct and random monsters start generating instead, which hurts the flavor
of places in the game designed for wolves.
