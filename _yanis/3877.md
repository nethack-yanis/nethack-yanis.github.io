Replace poison instadeath with a system where poison sticks around in your
system for a fairly long time, allowing multiple doses to build up and
eventually kill you if you're careless. This means when faced with a swarm of
poisoning monsters or orcs with poisoned arrows, you still have incentive to
flee, but won't cheaply die to the first one or two.
