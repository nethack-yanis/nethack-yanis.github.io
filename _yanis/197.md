Candle additions:
* Wielding a candle should give it a light radius of 3 (at the obvious expense
  of not having a weapon).
* Hitting enemies with a lit candle (thrown or melee) should have an 80% chance
  of extinguishing the flame and a 20% chance of lighting them on fire, doing
  2d3 fire damage.
* A lit candle should be able to be applied to an adjacent burnable object
  (door, tree, wood golem, paper golem) to light it on fire.
