A blessed ring of sustain ability will protect you from getting level drained,
but only once. This could possibly be achieved by removing the blessing, so you
could protect against another level drain by re-blessing the ring; or it could
be implemented by setting a flag on the ring, so once a ring protects you, it
can't ever be used again; you would need a different ring to get the benefit
again.
