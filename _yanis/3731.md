Armor of life saving (unspecified whether it would be magical body armor or some
other sort of armor like a helm, or even an object property on existing armor).
When it saves your life, it crumbles to dust like the amulet does, as well as
any other source of life saving you happened to have, to prevent
double-life-saving exploits.
