Spell of flash: upon casting it, you are prompted to choose a direction in which
to hurl a "ball of light" object.
- The ball belongs to the venom class because it is insubstantial; it does not
  ordinarily deal any damage.
- It possibly has no maximum range and can fly across the entire map if there's
  a clear path.
- Upon hitting something, it bursts and permanently lights up a 3x3 area. If it
  hits a monster, the monster is blinded. If the monster is a gremlin, it takes
  extra damage from the flash.

It's not clear which spell school this should be in:
- Divination, because it is similar to the spell of light?
- Attack, because it can be used as an attack?
- Enchantment, because it debuffs stuff?
- Clerical, because light-based attacks fit the flavor?
