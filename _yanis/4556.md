Add a new Researcher role to SLASHTHEM, based on its Drunk role, but based on
scrolls instead of potions: they start with a bunch of random scrolls but not
much else, and have a technique that creates identify scrolls but stuns you in
the process (which might be redundant with the existing research technique).
