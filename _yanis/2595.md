Extension of the feature in several variants where monster spawns are concentrated on the upstairs during the ascension run: occasionally, instead of spawning a monster, generate an organized group which is trying to get the Amulet, usually made up of sapient monsters (such as a group of soldiers, or a few priests of the same god, or some elves led by a couple elf-lords). Possibly, this only happens after you get back out of Gehennom and are again visible to the other gods.
