Druids should be able to farlook a nearby tree to determine what its contents
are:
- "You see a bees' nest" if the tree still contains a bees' nest.
- "You see low hanging fruit" if the tree still contains fruit (though this
  message may need to be changed if the tree contains non-fruit like eucalyptus
  or mistletoe.
- "This tree looks barren" if it contains nothing.
