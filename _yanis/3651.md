The drain life spell heals you with some of the HP you drained from your target,
possibly even increasing maximum HP by one point if it is full (though this
is probably too powerful).

The healing isn't intended for anyone who can cast it; it would require you to
have a certain amount of attack skill and possibly be chaotic.
