Holes and trapdoors should be made determinstic, by doing the following: Any
time something uses a hole or trapdoor, seed a special RNG with the x, y, and z
coordinates of the hole or trapdoor, and use it to generate the destination
level. Store the RNG state with the migrating monster or object (or player), and
use it again when that level is loaded to select a landing spot.
