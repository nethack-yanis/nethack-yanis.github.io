If Orcish Town is generated, guarantee a "peaceful" Mines' End where all the inhabitants, surviving shopkeepers, watchmen and the priest have fled. Chatting to the priest will make him ask you to clear the orcs out of Orcish Town, upon which chatting to him again will make him grant you a protection boon and give you a luckstone.
* Internally, this can be done by setting a global flag if and only if Orcish Town generates, and only load the peaceful Mines' End if that flag has been set. If you manage to get to the bottom of the Mines without yet generating Minetown, you are guaranteed not to generate the peaceful Mines' End, and Orcish Town will not generate either.
