Make death messages more diverse and flavorful. Base it on the attack type of the monster and possibly the weapon used, so that "killed by a jackal" becomes "clawed/mauled/shredded by a jackal", "killed by a gnome" becomes "bludgeoned to death by a gnome" if it was wielding an aklys, "stabbed to death by a gnome" if it was wielding a dagger, etc.
