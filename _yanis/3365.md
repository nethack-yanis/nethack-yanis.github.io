Anthill: a dungeon feature found exclusively in antholes that acts as a monster
spawner for ants. The ants produced will all be the same type as the anthole is,
and ants will not spawn out of it when there are already a certain number of
ants in the area. Eventually it stops spawning ants (perhaps with a system where
it rolls every time it creates a new ant and if it fails the roll it increments
an internal counter; the higher the counter gets the lower the chance of
spawning more ants), or the player can prematurely destroy it by digging it.

To compensate for the extra ants spawned, antholes could no longer be packed
full of ants.
