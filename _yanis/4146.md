The game should not assume heroes all carry an unlimited invisible box of
matches to light candles and lamps with. Doing that should require a fire
source, whether that is Fire Brand, lava, a fire trap, the wand of fire, the
fireball spell, or an already lit candle, lamp, or potion of oil. There could
also be a new "lighter" tool which enables you to light things, but can get lost
or run out of charges.
