A monster that emits non-persistent darkness in an area, just like how various
monsters shed light in an area.

Various monsters have been suggested for this effect:
- Black lights are one that already exists; this would invert its current light
  radius of 1 into darkness.
- A shadow dragon.
- A darkness elemental, which in addition to shedding a radius of darkness, also
  permanently darkens squares it moves throught by removing the lit state.
