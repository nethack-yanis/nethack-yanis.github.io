Allow the Oracle to tell you where certain unique monsters are currently
located. Internally, this works by setting a variable that represents the floor
the monster was last sighted on, which gets set when you leave a level with that
monster on it and the monster does not follow you. When the Oracle is asked to
find a monster, the code first scans through the migrating monsters list to see
if the monster is heading to a specific floor, and if it appears on the list she
just tells you that level. But if it's not on the list, the code checks the
last-seen variable for that monster, and if it has been set, she tells you that
level. If it has not been set, you have never been on the same level with the
monster and can't have encountered it yet.
