Make the Castle chest protected by a magical lock that is connected to one of
the gems in the storeroom. The chest can only be opened by having the gemstone
no longer be on the level (throwing it down a trapdoor, carrying it off-level,
destroying it, etc) or by having the gem in your inventory when you try to open
the chest.
