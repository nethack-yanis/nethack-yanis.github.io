Items that get thoroughly eroded become unusable until they are repaired, with
some message like "Your shield is so burnt that it can no longer stay on your
arm. It falls to the ground." or "Your sword is so thoroughly rusted that you
can't wield it." This is intended as a better alternative to the system in
several variants where items that erode 1 stage past thoroughly get destroyed
entirely. An alternative implementation is that thoroughly eroded armor is still
wearable but provides no AC benefit anymore, and thoroughly eroded weapons can
still be wielded but do no damage, or minimal "improvised object" damage.

This probably requires a secondary change in providing an easier way to repair
eroded gear than the existing confused enchant weapon/armor behavior, especially
since you won't be able to wear armor to get enchant armor scrolls to affect it.
