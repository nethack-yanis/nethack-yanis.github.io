Because Vorpal Blade delivering random, unpredictable instadeath is not fun to
be on the receiving end of, replace it (or just replace its instadeath effect)
with a "chaos blade" that has a bunch of random unpredictable effects, including
some that may backfire on the user.

Such a new artifact would almost certainly be chaotic rather than neutral.
