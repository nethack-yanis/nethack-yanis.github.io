New conduct, permaconflict, which must be enabled by setting an option. If you
play the game with this, you constantly generate conflict, which likely makes
some aspects of the game much easier and some much more difficult.

Not specified whether the permanent conflict would cause extra hunger like the
ring does, or not cause any like artifacts do.
