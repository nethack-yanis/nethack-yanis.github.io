Some weapons' unidentified appearances are shared with other weapons, so characters who start the game without knowledge of many weapons have to play a bit of an ID game with them. For instance, scimitar and katana could just be changed to "curved sword". This has problems, though: it doesn't translate very well to tiles (tiles of weapons sharing a description would have to be made identical), and it's vulnerable to weight-ID if two weapons with different weights share the same description.
