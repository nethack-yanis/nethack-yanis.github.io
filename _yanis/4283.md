New artifact _Bolt Boots_, jumping boots made out of copper or metal. Conveys
shock resistance when worn. Does double damage on kicks, which is treated as
shock damage that may destroy rings and wands in a monster's inventory.

When jumping with the boots, you may pass through monster's squares (but still
have to land on an open square); any monsters passed through will take damage as
if hit by a wand of lightning.
