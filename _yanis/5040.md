It should be possible to trigger some types of traps by throwing or shooting an
object onto them. This does open up the possibility of chain reactions, such as
triggering a land mine and objects flying around and landing on other traps, so
care should be taken when implementing it.

Whether each trap type should be triggerable by object requires deciding what
the triggering mechanism is. For most of them, "pressure plate" would work.
