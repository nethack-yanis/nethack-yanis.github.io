Add spheres that give buff effects and deal no damage to whatever they explode at. They target tame monsters if tame, and hostile monsters if hostile. There is a spell that summons them.

If monsters with area-of-effect passive attacks are implemented, these monsters should perhaps be eyes instead of spheres, and have the buff effect as their passive, and no explosion attack.
