New erosion type "moldy", which can be dealt to inventory items (or possibly
only weapons) when meleeing fungi. The mold does not appear instantly and maybe
does not even provoke a message when it appears. It does not have multiple
erosion levels, only the one "moldy", but at certain intervals of about a couple
hundred turns, moldy items in main inventory or carried containers have a chance
of turning another erodable item moldy as well.

It can be fixed by either standard methods of erosion removal, being subject to
fire damage, or possibly by smashing a potion of booze on oneself.
