A Rogue-aligned artifact (either a first gift or a crowning gift) that is some
sort of small blade whose invoke effect allows you to teleport behind nearby
enemies and attack them, perhaps with bonus backstab damage for a short time. Or
more powerfully, you instantaneously warp behind and backstab several different
enemies within a radius of 10 or 12 from you all at once.
