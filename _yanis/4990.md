You should be able to craft or apply dragon scales to a body armor piece, which
gives it a partial resistance to whatever the scales protect from, but only 1%
partial resistance per set of scales. However, different types of scales can be
mixed and matched, allowing you to get quite a good piece of armor if you kill
enough dragons.
