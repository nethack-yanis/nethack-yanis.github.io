With greasy fingers, you are incapable of playing flutes or harps, which require fine finger control. Attempting to do so just gives a message "Your fingers slip on the strings/valves".

Possibly, attempting to play any instrument with greasy fingers makes you fumble and drop it, since even things like horns and bugles which don't require finesse still need to be held.
