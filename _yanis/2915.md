Non-chaotic Priests get punished for having demon pets. The penalty is applied upon taming it and periodically from being on the same level as it, so that you can avoid penalties by abandoning it somewhere. (Internally, it should be applied when a tame demon moves; this means if you have multiple demon pets, the penalties stack up faster.)
