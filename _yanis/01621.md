Rat king (a randomly generated monster, not the SLASH'EM unique Rat King), based on the real-life [rat king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_king). It is a <span class="nhsym clr-magenta">r</span>, not much faster than a rock mole, but has several bite attacks (possibly scaling the amount by monster level). Each bite has a small chance of conferring disease. Its level corresponds to the number of entangled rats, so a slashing attack could sometimes cut off one rat, which then appears on the floor as a new rat, and makes the rat king lose a level.
