Wands of light should light up when wielded (in a radius of perhaps 3 or 2). To give them some limiting factor, they either lose a charge each time they are wielded, or there is a fixed chance per turn it's lit that it loses a charge. It's been noted that this would provide an incentive to try wielding every wand in order to determine if it's light, but this may not be a big problem.
