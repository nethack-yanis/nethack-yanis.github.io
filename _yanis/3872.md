A headless race, "Akephalos/oi", which has no head and its face on its chest, so
it is incapable of wearing helms, and is blinded (and cannot drink potions) if a
shirt or body armor is worn.

Also a dullahan/cephalophore race which Knights can play as. They are also
headless and cannot wear helms, but they carry their head as an item and can
place/throw it elsewhere. Vision is based on where the head is, so it is
possible to leave the head somewhere and have the body moving around blindly in
a different area of the map.
