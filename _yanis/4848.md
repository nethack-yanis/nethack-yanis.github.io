Add two types of vine to the plant class: a thief vine, which steals items from
you, and a warrior vine, which is only found in bones files near the pile, and
which starts with some weapons taken from the bones pile, which it uses to
attack you with. (It would generate just after loading the rest of the bones
level).

Thief vines, if adjacent to other thief vines, should pass stolen items away
from the player, playing keep-away with them.
