Replace the wand of teleportation with a potion of teleportation (leave the
ring and scroll, and possibly the spell of teleport away, as-is). You could
still teleport monsters, but possibly not objects any more, by throwing the
potion of teleportation which would then randomly teleport everything that it
gets on or which breathes its vapors.

This also is intended to make the Astral Plane more difficult by removing easy
zaps and snaps of the wand, making it a much more limited resource.
