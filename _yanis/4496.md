Pleather armor, an object that is mostly identical to leather armor, but is made
out of plastic.
- If you somehow eat it, it counts as vegan.
- It's much lighter than leather armor.
- If it gets exposed to extreme cold, it can become brittle and break.
- If it gets exposed to fire, it can melt, causing extra damage to the wearer.
