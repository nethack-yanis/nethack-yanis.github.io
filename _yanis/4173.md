Cave-in trap, which appears deep in the dungeon and/or in Gehennom. It causes
the ceiling to collapse all around the target, turning the spaces into stone
terrain, burying the target (potentially starting suffocating timers) and
dumping a few boulders and rocks in the vicinity. It works somewhat like
GruntHack cave-ins on the Plane of Earth, but in trap form.
