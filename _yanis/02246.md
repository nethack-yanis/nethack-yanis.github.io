The player can't cast spells or use magic items while standing on top of an anti-magic field. (Rather than straight up not being able to use the magic items, they would behave either like their non-magic counterparts, or as if they had no charges, as much as possible. Magic instruments would play normally, wands would fail to produce an effect, scrolls would have no effect, and so on.)
