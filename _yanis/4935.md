Invert the behavior of the "context.nopick" flag for better pacifist play, which
basically makes the game act as if you are prefacing every movement you make
with the m prefix. It's not perfect, as there are some odd corner cases with
digging, but it works great at preventing you from accidentally attacking
monsters.
