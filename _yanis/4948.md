Spell of dimension door, a level 2 or 3 escape spell that is intended as a
weaker version of teleport away: it randomly teleports you, possibly suppressing
your teleport control, and if you do successfully teleport, two bidirectional
teleport traps are created on your starting and ending position. The traps last
only a few turns before disappearing, but monsters will be able to follow you
through it until then.
