Shopping cart, a mobile container that can be used to hold and transport other
objects. When it contains at least 1 object, attempting to move onto its square
instead pushes it as if it were a boulder. If you m-move onto it or attempt to
push it into an obstacle, you instead move on top of it. Since you are not
personally carrying the objects in the cart, they do not add to your carry cap.

The main drawback is that it's unsuitable for taking down stairs. If you push it
onto a downstairs, it will fall down the stairs, spilling its contents on the
floor below and possibly breaking fragile ones. It can be carried down or up
stairs, but this will of course be impractical if you're trying to move a lot of
items.
