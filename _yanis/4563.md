Rework figurines to behave sort of like dNetHack crystal skulls. Applying them
summons a tame monster of the figurine's type, but produces a message "You call
forth the spirit in the figurine". The figurine does not get used up, and
remains linked to the monster; reapplying it while the monster exists will
recall it; it can then be resummoned again right away. If it dies while
summoned, the figurine cracks and becomes unusable. Possibly there is some way
to restore it, such as dipping it in a potion of restore ability.

In order to avoid tricky cases such as the summoned monster dying when the
figurine is not on the current level, it might automatically unsummon the
monster when the figurine and the monster stop being on the same level.
