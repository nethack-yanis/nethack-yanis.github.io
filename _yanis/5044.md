Clean up a potential continuity error in most quest texts - the message for
acquiring the artifact usually says you have to return it to the quest leader,
but the quest leader may be dead by the time you see the message.

Fix this by defining two additional messages: an alternate artifact-pickup
message that prints if your leader is dead and which doesn't mention returning
the artifact to the leader, and a message that always shows when the leader dies
about how your telepathic connection to them was suddenly severed.
