If the player is about to be hit with a death ray and has not yet expended their
saving grace, the saving grace protects them from the instadeath. Probably by
converting the ray hit (and any reflections from the same ray?) into a miss;
otherwise the game would have to explain why a non-resistant character got hit
by a death ray and failed to die.
