Welcome! This is a site which archives feature requests and suggestions
(aka <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/YANI">YANIs</a>) for the roguelike
game <a href="https://nethack.org">NetHack</a> -
<a href="http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com">The Greatest Game You Will Ever Play</a>.
The ultimate goal of this site is to preserve good ideas so they don't get
forgotten about, and to present them in an organized way so that developers and
interested players can use them.
</p>
<h4>Places To Go Here</h4>
<p>
Browse the <a href="/tags.html">list of tags</a>, or look up contributions by
<a href="/authors.html">author</a>.
</p>
<p>
Look at <a href="/all.html">all ideas sorted by newest first</a> or
<a href="/recent.html">the most recently added batch</a>.
</p>

<h4>Where the Ideas Come From</h4>
<p>
Most of the ideas on this site are drawn from logs of several channels on the
<a href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a> IRC chat network (formerly
Freenode), principally #nethack, #hardfought, ##nethack-discord, and
##nethack-variants. The logs are searched for certain strings such as "YANI" and
"feature request", then the chat is refined into a more readable form to be
shown here.
</p>
<p>
  There are several categories of idea that don't get put onto this site:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Silly, impractical, pointless, and non-serious ideas (YASIs).
    </li>
    <li>
      Vague ideas that lack enough details to do anything with (for instance,
      an idea that something unpopular should be changed... and that's it, no
      further details).
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Evil_Patch_Idea">Evil Patch Ideas.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Bugs, or ideas of the format "This is a bug; it should be fixed." These
      should be reported to the devteam instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ideas which already fully exist in some variant, in vanilla NetHack, or in
      the past of vanilla NetHack, and add nothing new. Though this is a bit
      flexible; in particular, an idea won't be removed from here because it was
      discovered later on that it already got implemented somewhere.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ideas created by a variant developer about their own variant and which
      could only be done in that variant. Sometimes an idea like this can be
      reformulated to be "variant-agnostic" or "vanilla-compatible"; if so,
      it's eligible to be posted here.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, ideas which never had any clearly identifiable discussion on
  IRC, such as suggestions made via GitHub, posts on RGRN, or someone writing
  their own ideas on a NetHackWiki page, likely won't make it on here. Not that
  that's a bad way to make suggestions; it's just tedious to sort through other
  forums to catch anything, and they tend to be more persistent than IRC.
  However, that's more a consequence of my time limitations for going out and
  searching for ideas; there is no reason why they can't be listed here. Feel
  free to make a pull request that adds them.
</p>
<h4>Note to Aspiring Variant Developers</h4>
<p>
  If you are thinking of making a NetHack variant, the ideas here are a great
  start - but make sure to talk about your plans with the NetHack community.
  Variants that are worked on in secret and then announced out of nowhere tend
  to have design or code issues that could have been fixed earlier if the
  community had known about it.
