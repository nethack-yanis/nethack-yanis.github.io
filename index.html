Welcome! This is a site which archives feature requests and suggestions
(aka <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/YANI">YANIs</a>) for the roguelike
game <a href="https://nethack.org">NetHack</a> -
<a href="http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com">The Greatest Game You Will Ever Play</a>.
The ultimate goal of this site is to preserve good ideas so they don't get
forgotten about, and to present them in an organized way so that developers and
interested players can use them.
</p>
<h4>Places To Go Here</h4>
<p>
Browse the <a href="/tags.html">list of tags</a>, or look up contributions by
<a href="/authors.html">author</a>.
</p>
<p>
Look at <a href="/all.html">all ideas sorted by newest first</a> and the list of
<a href="/bigideas.html">Big Ideas</a>.
</p>

<h4>Where the Ideas Come From</h4>
<p>
All of the ideas on this site are drawn from logs of several channels on the
<a href="https://freenode.net">Freenode</a> IRC chat network, principally
#nethack, #hardfought, ##nethack-discord, and ##nethack-variants. The logs are
searched for certain strings such as "YANI" and "feature request", then the chat
is refined into a more readable form to be shown here.
</p>
<p>
  There are several categories of idea that don't get put onto this page:
  <ul>
    <li>Silly, impractical, pointless, and non-serious ideas (YASIs).</li>
    <li><a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Evil_Patch_Idea">Evil Patch Ideas.</a></li>
    <li>Ideas which already fully exist in some variant or in vanilla NetHack and add nothing new.</li>
    <li>Ideas created by a variant developer about their own variant and which could only be done in that variant. Sometimes an idea like this can be reformulated to be "variant-agnostic" or "vanilla-compatible"; if so, it's eligible to be posted here.</li>
  </ul>
