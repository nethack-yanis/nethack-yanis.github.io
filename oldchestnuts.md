This file describes YANIs which keep getting suggested for vanilla NetHack, but
which are ineligible to be posted on the main site because they were implemented
in one or more variants before the idea was added. It exists just to keep an
easily accessible list of "I'm sure some variant has that already" ideas.

This list is not in any way comprehensive.

- Bonuses for using your own race's gear. Most likely boosts to to-hit and
  damage for weapons, and boosts to AC for armor. Issues raised with this idea
  are that it further disadvantages humans who have no "human gear", and
  similarly gnomes have little in the way of gnomish gear. Also, most racial
  gear is nonmagical, so it seems like an early-game thing at best before the
  hero moves on to stronger options.
- Naming an artifact should not break illiterate.
- Crystal plate mail should have its weight reduced.
- Shopkeeper services.
- Reflectionless and MRless conducts.
- Spell of erodeproofing.
- BUC identifying items in containers dropped on altars.
- Inventory weight display outside of wizard mode.
- The Wizard of Yendor should not be able to steal your role's quest artifact.
- Items on stairs should be highlighted.
- Rogues should have a direct theft attack to steal from monsters.
- The Caveman quest artifact shouldn't be an alignment based mace, it should be
  something more flavorful to the role, like a club.
- A "slowed" status that slowing attacks use instead of stripping intrinsic
  speed, which supersedes any extrinsic speed you have.
- Monsters too weak to show up as warning level 1 should appear as warning level
  0.
- Cavemen have a huge amount of HP maximum compared to other roles.
- Remove spells no one uses like cure blindness and detect food.
- The ability to give and take items from pets via #loot.
- The ability to move items from one container directly into another container.
