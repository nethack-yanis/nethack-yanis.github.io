This file describes YANIs which keep getting suggested for vanilla NetHack, but
which are ineligible to be posted on the main site because they were implemented
in one or more variants before the idea was added. It exists just to keep an
easily accessible list of "I'm sure some variant has that already" ideas.

This list is not in any way comprehensive.

- Bonuses for using your own race's gear. Most likely boosts to to-hit and
  damage for weapons, and boosts to AC for armor. Issues raised with this idea
  are that it further disadvantages humans who have no "human gear", and
  similarly gnomes have little in the way of gnomish gear. Also, all racial gear
  is nonmagical, so it seems like an early-game thing at best before the hero
  moves on to stronger options.
- Naming an artifact should not break illiterate.
- Crystal plate mail should have its weight reduced.
- Shopkeeper services.
- Reflectionless and MRless conducts.
